Java Development Setup & Basics
Setting Up Java
Java Development Kit (JDK) - Converts your Java code into bytecode that computers can understand. Think of it as a translator for your code.

IntelliJ IDEA (IDE) - Your coding workspace with helpful tools (like a fancy text editor with superpowers).

Creating Your First Program
Create a new project in IntelliJ

Make a class named Main

Add this essential code structure:

java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Your code goes here
}
This is your program's starting point - Java looks for this exact method to begin running.

Displaying Information
System.out.print() - Shows text without moving to the next line

System.out.println() - Shows text, then goes to the next line

\n - The invisible "enter" key for your text

Helpful Notes
End most lines with ; - It tells Java "this instruction is complete"

Use // for single-line comments or /* */ for multi-line notes (Java ignores these)

In IntelliJ, type sout then press Tab for quick System.out.println()

Customize your console colors for better visibility

Activities to Complete
Activity 1: Personal Introduction Program
Create a program that introduces yourself. It should:

Display your name on one line

Show your favorite hobby on the next line

Share one interesting fact about yourself on a third line

Use both println() and print() with \n at least once

Activity 2: Text Art Creator
Make a program that creates simple text art (like an animal, emoji, or object) using only print() statements. For example:

text
   /\
  /  \
 /____\
   ||
   ||
Requirements:

Must be at least 5 lines tall

Cannot use println() - only print() with \n

Add a comment explaining what your art represents

Activity 3: Debug Challenge
Fix this broken code that has multiple errors:

java
public class Main {
    public static main(String[] args) {
        system.out.print("Shopping List:")
        System.out.println("1. Milk"
        System.out.println("2. Eggs);
        System.out.println("3. Bread")
        // Total items: 3
    }
}
Errors to fix:

Missing keyword in main method

Wrong capitalization in "system"

Missing semicolons

Unclosed quotation marks

Missing closing parentheses

Make the comment a multi-line comment
