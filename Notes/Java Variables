Java Variables
What are Variables?
A variable is a reusable container for a value. It behaves as if it contains the value it holds.

Variable Categories
There are two main categories of variables in Java:

Primitive Variables
Definition: Simple values stored directly in memory (on the "stack").
Data Types:
int: Stores whole numbers (integers).
Example: int age = 21;
double: Stores numbers that can include a decimal portion.
Example: double price = 19.99;
char: Stores a single character. Characters are enclosed in single quotes.
Example: char grade = 'A';
boolean: Stores a truth value, either true or false.
Example: boolean isStudent = true;
Reference Variables
Definition: Store memory addresses (on the "stack") that point to locations in a different area of memory called the "heap."
Data Types (covered in this material):
String: Stores a sequence of characters (text). Strings are enclosed in double quotes.
Example: String name = "Bro Code";
Primitive Data Types in Detail
int (Integer)
Purpose: To store whole numbers without any decimal part.
Declaration: int variableName;
Assignment: variableName = value;
Combined Declaration and Assignment: int variableName = value;
Examples:
int age = 21;
int year = 2025;
int quantity = 1;
Important Note: Assigning a double value to an int variable will result in an error because int cannot hold decimal values.
double
Purpose: To store numbers that can have a decimal part.
Declaration: double variableName;
Assignment: variableName = value;
Combined Declaration and Assignment: double variableName = value;
Examples:
double price = 19.99;
double gpa = 3.5;
double temperature = -12.5;
Note: Assigning an int value to a double variable will automatically append .0 to the value.
char (Character)
Purpose: To store a single character. Characters must be enclosed in single quotes (').
Declaration: char variableName;
Assignment: variableName = 'value';
Combined Declaration and Assignment: char variableName = 'value';
Examples:
char grade = 'A';
char symbol = '!';
char currency = '$';
Important Note: Do not confuse single quotes for char with double quotes for String.
boolean
Purpose: To store one of two values: true or false.
Declaration: boolean variableName;
Assignment: variableName = true; or variableName = false;
Combined Declaration and Assignment: boolean variableName = true;
Camel Case Naming Convention: For variable names consisting of multiple words, the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., isStudent, forSale).
Examples:
boolean isStudent = true;
boolean forSale = false;
boolean isOnline = true;
Usage: Often used in conditional statements (if statements) to control program flow.
Reference Data Types in Detail
String
Purpose: To store a sequence of characters (text). Strings are enclosed in double quotes (").
Declaration: String variableName;
Assignment: variableName = "value";
Combined Declaration and Assignment: String variableName = "value";
Examples:
String name = "Bro Code";
String food = "pizza";
String email = "fake123@gmail.com";
String car = "Mustang";
String color = "red";
String Concatenation: You can combine strings with other strings or variables using the + operator.
Example: System.out.println("Hello " + name); would output "Hello Bro Code".
Note: Strings can contain numbers, but they are treated as characters, not as values for mathematical operations.
Outputting Variables
You can print the value of variables to the console using System.out.println().

Printing a single variable:
int age = 30;
System.out.println(age); // Output: 30
Printing a variable with text (concatenation):
String car = "Mustang";
int year = 2025;
System.out.println("Your choice is a " + car + " " + year); // Output: Your choice is a Mustang 2025
Pay attention to spacing when concatenating strings and variables. Add spaces within quotes where needed.
Example: Combining Variables in Output
Let's say you have the following variables:

String color = "red";
int year = 2025;
String car = "Mustang";
double price = 199999.99;
char currency = '$';
boolean forSale = true;
You can combine these in a print statement:

System.out.println("Your choice is a " + color + " " + year + " " + car);
System.out.println("The price is: " + currency + price);

if (forSale) {
    System.out.println("There is a " + car + " for sale");
} else {
    System.out.println("The " + car + " is not for sale");
}
Expected Output:

Your choice is a red 2025 Mustang
The price is: $199999.99
There is a Mustang for sale
