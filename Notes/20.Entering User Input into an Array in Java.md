# Entering User Input into an Array in Java

## Introduction to Arrays

An array in Java is a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same data type. Before assigning values to an array, the compiler needs to know its size.

---

## Array Declaration and Initialization

### Fixed Size:
Once an array's size is set, it generally cannot be changed.

### Initializing with Values:
You can declare and initialize an array with specific values directly.

```java
String[] foods = {"pizza", "taco", "hamburger"};
```
In this example, the `foods` array has a size of 3.

### Creating an Empty Array with a Defined Size:
To create an array that is initially empty but has a predetermined capacity, you use the `new` keyword.

```java
String[] foods = new String[3];
```
This creates an array named `foods` that can hold 3 `String` elements. The elements are initially `null` for objects or default values for primitive types.

---

## Array Indexing

Array elements are accessed using zero-based indexing. The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

- If you try to access an index that is outside the bounds of the array (e.g., index 0 for an array of size 0, or index 3 for an array of size 3), you will get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

---

## Accessing Array Length

The `length` property of an array returns the number of elements it can hold.

```java
int arrayLength = foods.length;
```

---

## Accepting User Input

To allow users to provide input for an array, you need to use the `Scanner` class.

### The Scanner Class

1. **Import:** You must import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

2. **Instantiate:** Create a `Scanner` object, typically linked to `System.in` for standard input.
   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   ```

3. **Reading Input:**
   - `scanner.nextLine()`: Reads the entire line of text entered by the user as a `String`.
   - `scanner.nextInt()`: Reads the next integer entered by the user.
   - `scanner.nextDouble()`: Reads the next double entered by the user.

4. **Closing the Scanner:** It's good practice to close the scanner when you are finished with it to release system resources.
   ```java
   scanner.close();
   ```

### Handling Input Buffers (Important for `nextInt()` followed by `nextLine()`)

When you read an integer using `scanner.nextInt()`, the newline character (`\n`) that the user presses after entering the number remains in the input buffer. If you immediately try to read a `String` using `scanner.nextLine()`, it will consume this leftover newline character instead of waiting for actual string input.

To fix this, you need to clear the input buffer after reading an integer and before reading a string. The easiest way is to call `scanner.nextLine()` once after `scanner.nextInt()`.

```java
// Example of clearing the buffer
int number = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.nextLine(); // Consumes the newline character
String text = scanner.nextLine(); // Now reads the actual text input
```

## Populating an Array with User Input

### Scenario 1: Array Size is Known

If you know the exact size of the array beforehand, you can create an empty array of that size and then use a loop to fill it with user input.

**Steps:**

1. Import `java.util.Scanner`.
2. Instantiate a `Scanner` object.
3. Declare and instantiate an empty array with a fixed size.
   ```java
   String[] foods = new String[3]; // Array for 3 food items
   ```
4. Use a `for` loop to iterate from index 0 up to (but not including) the array's length.
5. Inside the loop, prompt the user to enter a value.
6. Read the user's input using `scanner.nextLine()`.
7. Assign the input to the current array element using the loop's index.
8. After the loop, close the scanner.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String[] foods = new String[3]; // Array to hold 3 food items

        System.out.println("Please enter three food items:");

        for (int i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter food #" + (i + 1) + ": ");
            foods[i] = scanner.nextLine(); // Read input and assign to array element
        }

        System.out.println("\n--- Your Food Items ---");
        for (String food : foods) { // Enhanced for-loop to print
            System.out.println(food);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Scenario 2: Array Size is Determined by User Input

If the user decides how many elements the array should have, you need to get this size from the user before creating the array.

**Steps:**

1. Import `java.util.Scanner`.
2. Instantiate a `Scanner` object.
3. Prompt the user to enter the desired size of the array.
4. Read the user's integer input for the size.
5. **Crucially:** Clear the input buffer using `scanner.nextLine()` if you plan to read strings afterward.
6. Declare and instantiate the array using the user-provided size.
   ```java
   int size = scanner.nextInt(); // Get size from user
   scanner.nextLine(); // Clear buffer
   String[] foods = new String[size]; // Create array with user-defined size
   ```
7. Use a `for` loop (similar to Scenario 1) to prompt the user for each element and populate the array.
8. After the loop, close the scanner.

**Example Code Snippet:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DynamicUserInputArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("How many food items do you want to enter? ");
        int size = scanner.nextInt(); // Read the desired number of items
        scanner.nextLine(); // !!! IMPORTANT: Clear the input buffer !!!

        String[] foods = new String[size]; // Create the array with the specified size

        System.out.println("Please enter " + size + " food items:");

        for (int i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter food #" + (i + 1) + ": ");
            foods[i] = scanner.nextLine(); // Read input and assign
        }

        System.out.println("\n--- Your Food Items ---");
        for (String food : foods) {
            System.out.println(food);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

## Summary of Key Concepts

1. Arrays require a defined size at creation.
2. Use `new` keyword to create an empty array with a specified size.
3. `array.length` provides the number of elements.
4. `Scanner` class is used for reading user input.
5. `scanner.nextLine()` reads a whole line as a `String`.
6. `scanner.nextInt()` reads an integer.
7. Be mindful of the input buffer when mixing `nextInt()` and `nextLine()`; use `scanner.nextLine()` to clear it.
8. A `for` loop is typically used to iterate through array elements for input or output.

## Activity 1: Student Database Builder
Create a program that builds a student database using arrays and user input:

**Requirements:**
1. **Dynamic Database:**
   - Ask user how many students to add
   - Create parallel arrays for: names, IDs, ages, GPAs
   - Include an array for majors (optional field)

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Names: must not be empty
   - IDs: must be positive integers, no duplicates
   - Ages: 18-65 range
   - GPAs: 0.0-4.0 range

3. **Database Operations:**
   - Search for student by name or ID
   - Update student information
   - Calculate class average GPA
   - List all students above/below certain GPA

**Example Interface:**
```
STUDENT DATABASE BUILDER
========================
How many students? 3

Student 1:
Name: Alice Johnson
ID: 1001
Age: 20
GPA: 3.8
Major: Computer Science

Student 2: 
... etc
```

**Advanced Features:**
