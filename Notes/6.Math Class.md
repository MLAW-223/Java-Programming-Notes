# The Java Math Class

## Introduction to Math Constants

The `java.lang.Math` class provides several useful mathematical constants that can be accessed directly.

- **`Math.PI`**: Represents the mathematical constant π (pi), which is approximately 3.14159.
- **`Math.E`**: Represents the mathematical constant e (Euler's number), the base of the natural logarithm, which is approximately 2.71828.

## Common Math Methods

The Math class offers a variety of static methods for performing common mathematical operations.

### Powers and Roots

- **`Math.pow(double a, double b)`**: Returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the second argument.
  - Example: `Math.pow(3, 4)` calculates 3⁴, which equals 81.
  
- **`Math.sqrt(double a)`**: Returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value.
  - Example: `Math.sqrt(16)` calculates √16, which equals 4.0.

### Absolute Value

- **`Math.abs(double a)`**: Returns the absolute value of a double value.
  - Example: `Math.abs(-5)` returns 5.0.

### Rounding and Truncation

- **`Math.round(double a)`**: Returns the closest long to the argument. This method rounds to the nearest integer, with ties rounding up.
  - Example: `Math.round(3.14)` returns 3.
  - Example: `Math.round(3.7)` returns 4.

- **`Math.ceil(double a)`**: Returns the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. This effectively rounds up.
  - Example: `Math.ceil(3.14)` returns 4.0.

- **`Math.floor(double a)`**: Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity) double value that is less than or equal to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. This effectively rounds down.
  - Example: `Math.floor(3.99)` returns 3.0.

### Comparison

- **`Math.max(double a, double b)`**: Returns the greater of two double values.
  - Example: `Math.max(10, 20)` returns 20.0.

- **`Math.min(double a, double b)`**: Returns the lesser of two double values.
  - Example: `Math.min(10, 20)` returns 10.0.

## Exercise 1: Calculating the Hypotenuse

This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem: **c = √(a² + b²)**, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HypotenuseCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        double sideA;
        double sideB;
        double hypotenuse;

        System.out.print("Enter the length of side A: ");
        sideA = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the length of side B: ");
        sideB = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem
        // c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
        hypotenuse = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(sideA, 2) + Math.pow(sideB, 2));

        System.out.println("The hypotenuse is: " + hypotenuse + "cm");

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import Scanner**: We import the Scanner class to read user input from the console.
2. **Create Scanner Object**: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates an instance of the Scanner class.
3. **Declare Variables**: `sideA`, `sideB`, and `hypotenuse` are declared as `double` to store the lengths of the sides and the calculated hypotenuse.
4. **Get User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter the lengths of side A and side B, and these values are stored in `sideA` and `sideB` using `scanner.nextDouble()`.
5. **Calculate Hypotenuse**:
   - `Math.pow(sideA, 2)` calculates sideA².
   - `Math.pow(sideB, 2)` calculates sideB².
   - These two results are added together.
   - `Math.sqrt(...)` calculates the square root of the sum, giving us the hypotenuse.
6. **Display Result**: The calculated hypotenuse is printed to the console, along with a unit of measurement.
7. **Close Scanner**: `scanner.close()` releases system resources associated with the Scanner.

## Exercise 2: Circle and Sphere Calculations

This exercise involves calculating the circumference, area of a circle, and the volume of a sphere given its radius.

### Formulas:

- **Circumference of a circle**: C = 2πr
- **Area of a circle**: A = πr²
- **Volume of a sphere**: V = (4/3)πr³

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class GeometryCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        double radius;
        double circumference;
        double area;
        double volume;

        System.out.print("Enter the radius: ");
        radius = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate Circumference
        circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;

        // Calculate Area
        area = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);

        // Calculate Volume
        // Use 4.0/3.0 to ensure floating-point division
        volume = (4.0 / 3.0) * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3);

        // Using printf for formatted output
        System.out.printf("The circumference is: %.1fcm\n", circumference);
        System.out.printf("The area is: %.1fcm²\n", area);
        System.out.printf("The volume is: %.1fcm³\n", volume);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import and Initialize Scanner**: Similar to the previous exercise, we import Scanner and create a Scanner object.
2. **Declare Variables**: `radius`, `circumference`, `area`, and `volume` are declared as `double`.
3. **Get User Input**: The user is prompted to enter the radius, which is stored in the `radius` variable.
4. **Calculate Circumference**: `circumference` is calculated using `2 * Math.PI * radius`.
5. **Calculate Area**: `area` is calculated using `Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2)`.
6. **Calculate Volume**: `volume` is calculated using `(4.0 / 3.0) * Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 3)`. Note that `4.0 / 3.0` is used instead of `4 / 3` to ensure that floating-point division is performed, yielding a more accurate result.
7. **Formatted Output with printf**:
   - `System.out.printf()` is used to format the output.
   - `%.1f` is a format specifier that means "print a floating-point number with exactly one digit after the decimal point."
   - `\n` represents a newline character.
   - The variables `circumference`, `area`, and `volume` are passed as arguments to `printf` to be inserted into the formatted strings.
   - Units like cm, cm² (superscript two), and cm³ (superscript three) are included.
8. **Close Scanner**: The Scanner is closed.

## The printf Method for Formatted Output

The `System.out.printf()` method allows for more control over how output is displayed, including specifying the number of decimal places for floating-point numbers.

- **Format Specifier**: `%f` is used for floating-point numbers.
- **Precision**: `%.<number>f` specifies the number of digits to display after the decimal point. For example, `%.1f` displays one digit after the decimal.

Example of printf usage:

```java
double value = 123.456789;
System.out.printf("Formatted value: %.2f\n", value); // Output: Formatted value: 123.46
```
