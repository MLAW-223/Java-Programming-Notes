# Java Logical Operators

## Introduction

Logical operators in Java are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions. They allow you to evaluate multiple conditions together, enabling more complex decision-making within your code.

---

## Logical AND (&&)

The logical AND operator (`&&`) is used to check if **all** conditions connected by it are `true`. If even one condition is `false`, the entire expression evaluates to `false`.

**Syntax:** `condition1 && condition2`

### Explanation:

- If `condition1` is **true** AND `condition2` is **true**, the expression is **true**.
- If `condition1` is true and `condition2` is false, the expression is false.
- If `condition1` is false and `condition2` is true, the expression is false.
- If `condition1` is false and `condition2` is false, the expression is false.

### Example:

```java
int temperature = 20;

if (temperature >= 0 && temperature <= 30) {
    System.out.println("The weather is good.");
}
```

In this example, the temperature is 20:
- `temperature >= 0` evaluates to `true` (20 is greater than or equal to 0).
- `temperature <= 30` evaluates to `true` (20 is less than or equal to 30).

Since both conditions are `true`, the entire if statement's condition is `true`, and "The weather is good." is printed.

If temperature were 40:
- `temperature >= 0` would be `true`.
- `temperature <= 30` would be `false`.

Because one condition is `false`, the `&&` operator makes the entire expression `false`, and the code inside the if block would not execute.

### Chaining Multiple Conditions:

```java
boolean isSunny = true;
int temperature = 25;

if (temperature >= 0 && temperature <= 30 && isSunny) {
    System.out.println("It is sunny outside.");
}
```

For this code to execute, `temperature >= 0`, `temperature <= 30`, and `isSunny` must all be `true`.

---

## Logical NOT (!)

The logical NOT operator (`!`) inverts the Boolean value of an expression. If an expression is `true`, `!` makes it `false`, and if it's `false`, `!` makes it `true`.

**Syntax:** `!condition`

### Explanation:

- If `condition` is **true**, `!condition` is **false**.
- If `condition` is **false**, `!condition` is **true**.

### Example:

```java
boolean isSunny = false;
int temperature = 25;

if (temperature >= 0 && temperature <= 30 && !isSunny) {
    System.out.println("It is cloudy outside.");
}
```

In this example:
- `temperature >= 0` is `true`.
- `temperature <= 30` is `true`.
- `isSunny` is `false`.
- `!isSunny` evaluates to `true` (because `isSunny` is `false`).

Since all combined conditions (`true && true && true`) are `true`, "It is cloudy outside." is printed.

---

## Logical OR (||)

The logical OR operator (`||`) is used to check if **at least one** of the conditions connected by it is `true`. If all conditions are `false`, the entire expression evaluates to `false`.

**Syntax:** `condition1 || condition2`

### Explanation:

- If `condition1` is **true** OR `condition2` is **true**, the expression is **true**.
- If both `condition1` and `condition2` are true, the expression is true.
- If `condition1` is false AND `condition2` is false, the expression is false.

### Example:

```java
int temperature = -10;

if (temperature > 30 || temperature < 0) {
    System.out.println("The weather is bad.");
}
```

In this example, the temperature is -10:
- `temperature > 30` evaluates to `false` (-10 is not greater than 30).
- `temperature < 0` evaluates to `true` (-10 is less than 0).

Because one of the conditions (`temperature < 0`) is `true`, the `||` operator makes the entire expression `true`, and "The weather is bad." is printed.

If temperature were 35:
- `temperature > 30` would be `true`.
- `temperature < 0` would be `false`.

Again, because one condition is `true`, the entire expression is `true`, and the code executes.

## Combining Logical Operators

You can combine `&&`, `||`, and `!` to create sophisticated logical checks. Parentheses `()` can be used to control the order of evaluation, similar to mathematical expressions.

### Example: Username Validation

Let's consider validating a username with two rules:
1. Username must be between 4 and 12 characters long (inclusive).
2. Username must not contain spaces or underscores.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UsernameValidation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your new username: ");
        String username = scanner.nextLine();

        // Rule 1: Length validation
        boolean isLengthValid = username.length() >= 4 && username.length() <= 12;

        // Rule 2: Character validation
        boolean containsSpace = username.contains(" ");
        boolean containsUnderscore = username.contains("_");
        boolean containsInvalidChars = containsSpace || containsUnderscore;

        // Final validation
        if (!isLengthValid) {
            System.out.println("Username must be between 4 through 12 characters.");
        } else if (containsInvalidChars) {
            System.out.println("Username must not contain spaces or underscores.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Welcome " + username);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Example:

1. **Length Validation:**
   - `username.length() >= 4`: Checks if the username length is 4 or more.
   - `username.length() <= 12`: Checks if the username length is 12 or less.
   - `isLengthValid = username.length() >= 4 && username.length() <= 12;`: This uses the `&&` operator. The username's length is valid only if it meets both the minimum and maximum length requirements.

2. **Character Validation:**
   - `username.contains(" ")`: Checks if the username contains any space characters.
   - `username.contains("_")`: Checks if the username contains any underscore characters.
   - `containsInvalidChars = containsSpace || containsUnderscore;`: This uses the `||` operator. The username contains invalid characters if it has either a space or an underscore (or both).

3. **Final Validation Logic:**
   - `if (!isLengthValid)`: This checks if the length is not valid. If `isLengthValid` is `false`, then `!isLengthValid` is `true`, and the first error message is shown.
   - `else if (containsInvalidChars)`: If the length is valid, this checks if `containsInvalidChars` is `true`. If so, the second error message is shown.
   - `else`: If both the length is valid and it does not contain invalid characters, the welcome message is displayed.

# Logical Operators Activities

## Activity 1: Smart Home Automation System
Design a smart home system that uses logical operators to control devices:

**Rules:**
1. **Lights:**
   - Turn on if: (sunset AND someone is home) OR (motion detected AND it's dark)
   - Turn off if: sunrise OR (no motion for 30 minutes AND lights are on)

2. **Thermostat:**
   - Heating on if: (temperature < 68°F AND someone is home) OR (temperature < 60°F for freeze protection)
   - Cooling on if: (temperature > 78°F AND someone is home) OR (temperature > 85°F for pet safety)

3. **Security:**
   - Alarm armed if: (all doors/windows closed) AND (nobody home OR it's nighttime)
   - Send alert if: (motion detected AND alarm armed) OR (door opened AND nobody home)

**Create a program that:**
- Simulates various scenarios using boolean variables
- Uses logical operators to make decisions
- Provides clear output about what actions are taken
- Tests edge cases (e.g., what happens when multiple conditions are true?)

## Activity 2: Loan Application System
Create a loan approval system with multiple criteria:

**Approval Rules (ALL must be true):**
1. Age: 21-65 years
2. Income: At least $30,000/year OR co-signer available
3. Credit Score: At least 650 AND no bankruptcies in last 5 years
4. Debt-to-Income Ratio: Less than 40% OR (less than 50% AND co-signer)

**Loan Amount Calculation:**
- Base: 3× annual income
- If credit score > 750: +20%
- If debt-to-income < 30%: +10%
- If co-signer: -15% (reduced risk)
- Maximum cap: $500,000

**Create a program that:**
- Asks for applicant information
- Uses logical operators to check eligibility
- Calculates maximum loan amount
- Provides specific reasons for denial if applicable
- Handles special cases (retired applicants, self-employed, etc.)

## Activity 3: Game Character Ability System
Design a role-playing game ability system with complex requirements:

**Ability: "Dragon Slayer Strike"**
**Requirements:**
1. Character must be Level 10+ AND have "Swordsman" class
2. Must have "Dragon Slayer" skill OR "Legendary Sword" item
3. Must NOT be poisoned OR cursed
4. Must have at least 50% health AND 20% mana

**Ability Effects:**
- Base Damage: 100
- If (Level > 20 AND has "Legendary Sword"): ×2 damage
- If (fighting dragon-type enemy AND has "Dragon Slayer" skill): ×1.5 damage
- If (poisoned OR cursed): Cannot use ability
- If (health < 30%): 50% chance to fail

**Create a program that:**
- Tracks a character's stats and inventory
- Uses logical operators to check ability usage conditions
- Calculates damage with modifiers
- Simulates battle scenarios with different enemy types
- Provides detailed combat logs showing why certain modifiers applied
