# The Java Ternary Operator

## Introduction

The ternary operator in Java provides a concise way to write conditional expressions. It's a shorthand for a simple if-else statement, allowing you to return one of two values based on whether a condition evaluates to `true` or `false`.

---

## Syntax

The general syntax for the ternary operator is:

```java
variable = (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

- **`condition`**: An expression that evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
- **`?`**: The ternary operator symbol. It separates the condition from the possible return values.
- **`valueIfTrue`**: The value that will be returned if the condition is `true`.
- **`:`**: The colon separates the `valueIfTrue` from the `valueIfFalse`.
- **`valueIfFalse`**: The value that will be returned if the condition is `false`.

The entire expression `(condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse` evaluates to either `valueIfTrue` or `valueIfFalse`, and this result can then be assigned to a variable or used directly in another expression.

## Comparison with if-else Statements

The ternary operator is a more compact alternative to a basic if-else statement when you need to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.

**Using if-else:**

```java
int score = 70;
String passOrFail;

if (score >= 60) {
    passOrFail = "PASS";
} else {
    passOrFail = "FAIL";
}
```

**Using the Ternary Operator:**

```java
int score = 70;
String passOrFail = (score >= 60) ? "PASS" : "FAIL";
```

Both code snippets achieve the same result: if the score is 60 or greater, `passOrFail` will be assigned `"PASS"`; otherwise, it will be assigned `"FAIL"`.

## Common Use Cases and Examples

### 1. Checking for Even or Odd Numbers

The modulus operator (`%`) can be used to find the remainder of a division. If a number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0, it's even. Otherwise, it's odd.

**Example:**

Let's determine if the number 4 is even or odd.

- **Condition:** `number % 2 == 0`
- **valueIfTrue:** `"EVEN"`
- **valueIfFalse:** `"ODD"`

```java
int number = 4;
String evenOrOdd = (number % 2 == 0) ? "EVEN" : "ODD";
// evenOrOdd will be "EVEN"
```

If number were 3:

```java
int number = 3;
String evenOrOdd = (number % 2 == 0) ? "EVEN" : "ODD";
// evenOrOdd will be "ODD"
```

### 2. Determining Time of Day (AM/PM)

You can use the ternary operator to convert 24-hour military time into AM/PM format.

**Example:**

Let's determine if 13 hours represents AM or PM.

- **Condition:** `hours >= 12`
- **valueIfTrue:** `"PM"`
- **valueIfFalse:** `"AM"`

```java
int hours = 13;
String timeOfDay = (hours >= 12) ? "PM" : "AM";
// timeOfDay will be "PM"
```

If hours were 9:

```java
int hours = 9;
String timeOfDay = (hours >= 12) ? "PM" : "AM";
// timeOfDay will be "AM"
```

### 3. Assigning Tax Rates Based on Income

This demonstrates how the ternary operator can be used to select different values based on a numerical threshold, similar to tax brackets.

**Example:**

Calculate the tax rate for an income of $60,000 with a threshold of $40,000.

- **Condition:** `income >= 40000`
- **valueIfTrue:** `0.25` (representing 25%)
- **valueIfFalse:** `0.15` (representing 15%)

```java
double income = 60000;
double taxRate = (income >= 40000) ? 0.25 : 0.15;
// taxRate will be 0.25
```

If income were $30,000:

```java
double income = 30000;
double taxRate = (income >= 40000) ? 0.25 : 0.15;
// taxRate will be 0.15
```

## Key Takeaways

1. The ternary operator is a shorthand for simple if-else assignments.
2. It consists of a condition, a question mark (`?`), and a colon (`:`).
3. The expression evaluates to one of two values based on the boolean result of the condition.
4. It can make code more concise when used appropriately for straightforward conditional assignments.
5. For complex conditional logic, traditional if-else statements are generally more readable.

# Ternary Operator Activities

## Activity 1: Grading System with Multiple Conditions
Create a grading system that uses **nested ternary operators** to convert numerical scores to letter grades:

**Grading Scale:**
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

**Requirements:**
1. Use a single line of code with nested ternary operators
2. Handle invalid scores (less than 0 or greater than 100)
3. Add plus/minus grades:
   - A: 97-100 (A+), 93-96 (A), 90-92 (A-)
   - B: 87-89 (B+), 83-86 (B), 80-82 (B-)
   - Same pattern for C and D
4. Display both letter grade and GPA value (A=4.0, B=3.0, etc.)

**Challenge:** Can you do this with only ternary operators (no if-else)?

## Activity 2: Shipping Cost Calculator
Create a shipping cost calculator using ternary operators:

**Rules:**
1. **Domestic Shipping:**
   - Standard: $5.99 (3-5 days)
   - Express: $12.99 (1-2 days)
   - Free: Orders over $50 (standard only)

2. **International Shipping:**
   - Standard: $15.99 + $2/kg
   - Express: $25.99 + $5/kg
   - Remote locations: +$10 surcharge

3. **Special Handling:**
   - Fragile items: +$5
   - Large items: +$8
   - Hazardous materials: not eligible for express shipping

**Create a program that:**
- Uses ternary operators for each decision point
- Calculates final shipping cost in a single complex expression
- Handles edge cases (e.g., free shipping doesn't apply to express)
- Shows a breakdown of costs

## Activity 3: User Role and Permission System
Design a permission system using ternary operators:

**User Roles:**
1. **Guest:** Can only view public content
2. **User:** Can view + comment + like
3. **Moderator:** User permissions + delete comments + warn users
4. **Admin:** Moderator permissions + ban users + change settings
5. **Super Admin:** All permissions + manage other admins

**Permission Matrix:**
For each action, determine if allowed based on role:
- View content: All roles
- Comment: User, Moderator, Admin, Super Admin
- Delete comments: Moderator, Admin, Super Admin
- Ban users: Admin, Super Admin
- Manage admins: Super Admin only

**Create a program that:**
- Asks for user role and desired action
- Uses ternary operators to check permissions
- Returns either "Allowed" or "Denied" with reason
- Handles multiple actions in sequence

**Advanced:** Add conditional permissions based on:
- Account age (new users restricted)
- Content type (NSFW requires age verification)
- Time of day (some actions restricted to business hours)
