# FOR LOOPS in Java

## Introduction to For Loops

A for loop in Java is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It provides a concise way to control the initialization, condition, and update of a loop variable within a single statement. This makes for loops particularly useful when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat an action.

## Structure of a For Loop

The basic syntax of a for loop in Java is:

```java
for (statement1; statement2; statement3) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Each of the three statements within the parentheses is separated by a semicolon:

1. **`statement1` (Initialization):** This statement is executed only once at the beginning of the loop. It's commonly used to declare and initialize a loop control variable (often called a counter). A typical initialization is `int i = 0;`.
2. **`statement2` (Condition):** This statement is evaluated **before** each iteration of the loop. If the condition is `true`, the code block inside the loop is executed. If the condition is `false`, the loop terminates. A common condition is `i < 10;`.
3. **`statement3` (Update):** This statement is executed **after** each iteration of the loop. It's typically used to update the loop control variable, such as incrementing or decrementing it. Common updates include `i++` (increment by 1) or `i--` (decrement by 1).

## How a For Loop Works

1. **Initialization:** The `statement1` is executed once.
2. **Condition Check:** The `statement2` is evaluated.
3. **Execution:** If `statement2` is `true`, the code block within the loop is executed.
4. **Update:** After the code block is executed, `statement3` is executed.
5. **Repeat:** The process returns to step 2 (Condition Check).
6. **Termination:** If `statement2` is `false`, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the code following the loop.

## Examples of For Loops

### Example 1: Printing "pizza" 10 times

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("pizza");
}
```

In this example:
- `int i = 0;`: Initializes the counter `i` to 0.
- `i < 10;`: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 10.
- `i++`: Increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

This loop will execute 10 times, printing "pizza" on each line.

### Example 2: Printing the counter value

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This loop will print the numbers from 0 to 9, each on a new line.

### Example 3: Starting the counter at 1

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This loop will print the numbers from 1 to 10. Here, the condition is `i <= 10` to ensure the loop runs up to and including 10.

### Example 4: Decrementing the counter

```java
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This loop will print the numbers from 10 down to 1. The condition `i > 0` ensures the loop stops after printing 1.

### Example 5: Incrementing by a specific number

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i += 2) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This loop will print 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The `i += 2` statement increments the counter `i` by 2 in each iteration.

### Example 6: Decrementing by a specific number

```java
for (int i = 10; i > 0; i -= 3) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This loop will print 10, 7, 4, 1. The `i -= 3` statement decrements the counter `i` by 3 in each iteration.

## For Loops with User Input

You can use a for loop in conjunction with a Scanner to repeat an action based on user-defined input.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ForLoopUserInput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter how many times you want to loop: ");
        int max = scanner.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < max; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration number: " + i);
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- This number is stored in the `max` variable.
- The for loop runs from `i = 0` up to, but not including, `max`.

## Mini Project: Countdown Simulation

This project simulates a countdown, similar to a New Year's countdown.

```java
public class Countdown {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 10; // Starting number for the countdown

        // Loop from 'start' down to 1
        for (int i = start; i > 0; i--) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                // Pause for 1 second (1000 milliseconds)
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Restore interrupted status
                System.err.println("Countdown interrupted.");
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Happy New Year!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. The loop initializes `i` with the value of `start` (10).
2. The condition `i > 0` ensures the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than zero.
3. `i--` decrements `i` by 1 after each iteration.
4. Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is printed.
5. `Thread.sleep(1000);` pauses the execution for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) between each number printed.
6. The try-catch block is necessary because `Thread.sleep()` can throw an `InterruptedException`.
7. After the loop finishes (when `i` becomes 0), "Happy New Year!" is printed.

## For Loops vs. While Loops

- **For Loops:** Are best used when you know the exact number of iterations beforehand. They consolidate initialization, condition, and update in one place.
- **While Loops:** Are more flexible and are typically used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that might change during execution.

Both loop types can often be used interchangeably, but for loops offer a more structured and readable approach for situations with a fixed number of repetitions.

   - Mean (average)
   - Median
   - Mode
   - Range
   - Standard deviation

2. **Sorting Algorithms** (implement using for loops):
   - Bubble sort
   - Selection sort

2. Analysis phase: Perform chosen calculations using for loops
3. Output phase: Display results in clear format
4. Comparison phase: Show before/after sorting, highlight found values

**Example Scenario:**
```
Enter numbers: 5, 2, 8, 5, 1, 9, 5, 3

Statistics:
Mean: 4.75
Median: 5.0
Mode: 5 (appears 3 times)
Range: 8
Sorted: [1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 8, 9]
Search for 5: Found at positions 3, 4, 5 (0-based)
```

**Bonus:** Add file I/O to read data from CSV files and save analysis results.
