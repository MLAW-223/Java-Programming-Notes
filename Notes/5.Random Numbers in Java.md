# Working with Random Numbers in Java

## Importing the Random Class

To use Java's random number generation capabilities, you first need to import the Random class from the `java.util` package. This is done at the beginning of your Java file, similar to how you would import the Scanner class.

```java
import java.util.Random;
```

---

## Creating a Random Object

Once the Random class is imported, you need to create an instance (an object) of the Random class. This object will be used to call methods for generating random values. The syntax is as follows:

```java
Random random = new Random();
```

Here, `random` is the name of the variable that will hold our Random object.

## Generating Random Integers

The Random object provides several methods for generating random numbers. The most common is `nextInt()`.

### `nextInt()` without arguments

Calling `random.nextInt()` without any arguments will generate a random integer within the full range of Java's `int` data type. This range is very large, approximately from `-2×10⁹` to `+2×10⁹`.

```java
int largeNumber = random.nextInt();
System.out.println(largeNumber);
```

### `nextInt(int bound)`

More often, you'll want to generate a random integer within a specific range. The `nextInt(int bound)` method generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the specified bound (exclusive).

For example, to get a random number between 0 and 9 (inclusive):

```java
int numberUpToTen = random.nextInt(10); // Generates a number from 0 to 9
System.out.println(numberUpToTen);
```

### `nextInt(int origin, int bound)`

To generate a random integer within a specific range, including a starting point, you can use the `nextInt(int origin, int bound)` method. This method generates a random integer between `origin` (inclusive) and `bound` (exclusive).

**Example: Simulating a Dice Roll**

If you want to simulate rolling a standard six-sided die, you need numbers from 1 to 6. Using `random.nextInt(1, 7)` will achieve this:

- `origin` is 1 (inclusive).
- `bound` is 7 (exclusive).

This means the possible generated numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

```java
int dieRoll = random.nextInt(1, 7); // Generates a number from 1 to 6
System.out.println(dieRoll);
```

**Important Note:** The first parameter (`origin`) is inclusive, and the second parameter (`bound`) is exclusive.

---

## Generating Random Doubles

You can also generate random floating-point numbers. The `nextDouble()` method generates a random `double` value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).

```java
double randomDecimal = random.nextDouble(); // Generates a number between 0.0 and 0.999...
System.out.println(randomDecimal);
```

---

## Generating Random Booleans

The `nextBoolean()` method is useful for scenarios requiring a true/false outcome, such as simulating a coin flip. It returns `true` or `false` with approximately equal probability.

```java
boolean isHeads = random.nextBoolean();
```

---

## Using Booleans for Conditional Logic

You can easily integrate `nextBoolean()` with if statements to simulate events.

**Example: Simulating a Coin Flip**

```java
Random random = new Random();
boolean isHeads = random.nextBoolean();

if (isHeads) {
    System.out.println("HEADS");
} else {
    System.out.println("TAILS");
}
```

---

## Generating Multiple Random Numbers

You can call the random number generation methods multiple times to get several random values.

**Example: Rolling Three Dice**

```java
Random random = new Random();

int die1 = random.nextInt(1, 7);
int die2 = random.nextInt(1, 7);
int die3 = random.nextInt(1, 7);

System.out.println("Die 1: " + die1);
System.out.println("Die 2: " + die2);
System.out.println("Die 3: " + die3);
```

**Example: Generating Random Numbers between 1 and 100**

To generate numbers between 1 and 100, you would use `random.nextInt(1, 101)` because the upper bound is exclusive.

```java
Random random = new Random();

int num1 = random.nextInt(1, 101); // Generates a number from 1 to 100
int num2 = random.nextInt(1, 101);
int num3 = random.nextInt(1, 101);

System.out.println(num1);
System.out.println(num2);
System.out.println(num3);
```

# Random Number Activities

## Activity 1: Dice Game Simulator
Create a program that simulates rolling two dice and determines the outcome based on the sum:
- Roll two dice (1-6 each)
- Calculate the sum
- If sum is 7 or 11: "You win!"
- If sum is 2, 3, or 12: "You lose!"
- Any other sum: "Roll again"

**Challenge:** Add a feature that counts how many rolls it takes to get a 7.

## Activity 2: Random Password Generator
Create a program that generates a random password with these rules:
- Randomly choose a password length between 8 and 12 characters
- Each character should be randomly selected from:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Lowercase letters (a-z)
  - Numbers (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&*)

**Hint:** You might want to create a string containing all possible characters, then randomly select from it.

## Activity 3: Probability Experiment
Create a program that:
1. Simulates flipping a coin 100 times
2. Counts how many times it lands on heads and tails
3. Calculates the percentage for each
4. Repeats the experiment 10 times
5. Compares the results to the expected 50/50 distribution

**Extension:** Add a feature to let the user specify how many flips per experiment and how many experiments to run.
