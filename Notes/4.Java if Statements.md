# Java if Statements

## What is an if Statement?

An if statement in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

---

## Basic if Statement

The fundamental structure of an if statement is:

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

- **condition**: This is a Boolean expression that evaluates to either `true` or `false`
- The code within the curly braces `{}` is executed only when the condition evaluates to `true`

**Example:**

```java
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
}
```

In this example, if the `age` variable is greater than or equal to 18, the message "You are an adult." will be printed. If age were less than 18, this line of code would be skipped.

---

## if-else Statement

An if-else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the if condition is false.

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

**Example:**

```java
int age = 12;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a child.");
}
```

Here, since age is 12 (which is not greater than or equal to 18), the else block will be executed, printing "You are a child."

---

## if-else if-else Statement

You can chain multiple conditions using `else if`. This allows you to check several conditions in sequence. The `else` block at the end acts as a default if none of the preceding `if` or `else if` conditions are true.

```java
if (condition1) {
    // Code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // Code if condition1 and condition2 are false, and condition3 is true
} else {
    // Code if all previous conditions are false
}
```

### Key Points:

- The conditions are evaluated from top to bottom
- As soon as a condition evaluates to `true`, its corresponding code block is executed, and the rest of the `else if` and `else` blocks are skipped
- The `else` block is optional

**Example:**

```java
int age = 70;

if (age >= 65) {
    System.out.println("You are a senior.");
} else if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else if (age >= 0) {
    System.out.println("You are a child.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You haven't been born yet.");
}
```

In this scenario, age is 70:
- The first condition `age >= 65` is `true`
- The code within the first if block ("You are a senior.") is executed
- The remaining `else if` and `else` blocks are skipped

---

### Order Matters:

Consider the previous example with `age = 20`:

```java
int age = 20;

if (age >= 65) { // False
    System.out.println("You are a senior.");
} else if (age >= 18) { // True
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else if (age >= 0) {
    System.out.println("You are a child.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You haven't been born yet.");
}
```

Here, the first condition is false. The second condition `age >= 18` is true, so "You are an adult." is printed, and the rest are skipped.

**If the order were reversed:**

```java
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18) { // True
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else if (age >= 65) { // This condition will never be checked if the first is true
    System.out.println("You are a senior.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a child.");
}
```

**Important:** If age was 70 and the `if (age >= 18)` came first, the output would be "You are an adult.", even though "You are a senior." might also be a correct description. The positioning of your `if` and `else if` statements is crucial.

## Comparison Operators

These operators are used to form the conditions in if statements:

- **`>`**: Greater than
- **`<`**: Less than
- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to
- **`<=`**: Less than or equal to
- **`==`**: Equal to (use double equals for comparison)
- **`!=`**: Not equal to

### Important Note on Equality:

- Use `==` for comparing values (e.g., `age == 0`)
- Use `=` for assigning values to variables (e.g., `age = 0`)
- Using a single equals `=` in a condition will result in a compilation error because Java interprets it as an assignment attempt

---

## Working with Strings

When comparing strings, you **cannot** use the `==` operator to check for equality of content. Instead, you should use the `.equals()` method.

```java
String name = "Alice";

if (name.equals("Alice")) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Alice!");
}
```

To check if a string is empty, you can use the `.isEmpty()` method:

```java
String userName = ""; // Or obtained from user input

if (userName.isEmpty()) {
    System.out.println("You did not enter your name.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + userName + "!");
}
```

---

## Working with Booleans

Boolean variables (`true` or `false`) can be directly used in if statements:

```java
boolean isStudent = true;

if (isStudent) { // This is shorthand for if (isStudent == true)
    System.out.println("You are a student! 🏫");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are NOT a student 🏢");
}
```

---

## User Input with Scanner

To get input from the user, you can use the `Scanner` class.

1. **Import the Scanner class:**
   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;
   ```

2. **Create a Scanner object:**
   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   ```

3. **Read user input:**
   - For integers: `int value = scanner.nextInt();`
   - For strings (a single word): `String word = scanner.next();`
   - For strings (an entire line): `String line = scanner.nextLine();`
   - For booleans: `boolean boolValue = scanner.nextBoolean();`

4. **Close the Scanner when done:**
   ```java
   scanner.close();
   ```

**Example using Scanner:**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class AgeChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        if (age >= 18) {
            System.out.println("You are an adult.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are a child.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

#  Java if Statement Activities (Non-Code Version)

## Activity 1: Age Category Flowchart
**Objective:** Design a flowchart for an age categorization system.

**Instructions:**
1. Draw a flowchart starting with "Start Program"
2. Add a step: "Get age input from user"
3. Create decision diamonds for:
   - Is age less than 0? → "Invalid age" → End
   - Is age between 0 and 12? → "Child" → End
   - Is age between 13 and 17? → "Teenager" → End
   - Is age between 18 and 64? → "Adult" → End
   - Is age 65 or above? → "Senior" → End
4. Include all connection arrows between decision points
5. Consider: What happens if someone enters 12.5? How would you handle decimal ages?

**Thinking Points:**
- What order should you check the conditions in?
- Why shouldn't you check "age >= 18" first?
- How would you modify this for a voting age check (18+ only)?

---

## Activity 2: Conditional Scenario Analysis
**Objective:** Analyze real-world scenarios and translate them into if statement logic.

**Scenarios to Analyze:**

1. **Movie Ticket Pricing:**
   - Regular ticket: $15
   - Child (under 12): $8
   - Senior (65+): $10
   - Student (with ID): $12
   
   **Question:** Write the logical conditions (in plain English) that would determine ticket price. What order should you check these conditions? Why?

2. **Grading System:**
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: 0-59
   
   **Question:** Write the if-else if chain for this. What edge cases should you consider? (Hint: negative scores, scores above 100)

3. **Weather Clothing Advisor:**
   - If temperature > 80°F: "Wear shorts and t-shirt"
   - If temperature 60-80°F: "Wear light jacket"
   - If temperature 40-59°F: "Wear sweater"
   - If temperature < 40°F: "Wear coat"
   - If raining: add "and bring umbrella"
   
   **Question:** How would you structure this with nested if statements? What's the difference between using `&&` (AND) in a single condition vs. nested ifs?

---

## Activity 3: Error Detection & Logic Puzzles
**Objective:** Identify problems in given if statement logic and propose solutions.

**Puzzle 1 - String Comparison Bug:**
```java
String userRole = "admin";
String inputRole = getUserInput(); // Returns "admin"

if (userRole == inputRole) {
    System.out.println("Access granted");
} else {
    System.out.println("Access denied");
}
```
**Question:** Will this always work? Why or why not? What's the correct way to compare strings?

**Puzzle 2 - Order of Operations Problem:**
```java
int score = 85;

if (score >= 60) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else if (score >= 70) {
    System.out.println("Good");
} else if (score >= 85) {
    System.out.println("Excellent");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
```
**Question:** What will this print for score = 85? What's wrong with the order? How would you fix it?

**Puzzle 3 - Boolean Logic Challenge:**
```java
boolean hasTicket = true;
boolean hasID = false;
int age = 16;

// Current logic:
if (hasTicket) {
    if (hasID) {
        System.out.println("Entry allowed");
    } else {
        if (age >= 18) {
            System.out.println("Entry allowed");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Entry denied - no ID");
        }
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Entry denied - no ticket");
}
```
**Question:** 
1. Simplify this logic into fewer lines using `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR) operators
2. Create a truth table showing all possible combinations of hasTicket, hasID, and age≥18, and what the output would be

**Bonus Challenge:** Create your own "buggy" if statement scenario for a classmate to debug!
