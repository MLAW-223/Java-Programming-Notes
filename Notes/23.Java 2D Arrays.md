# Java 2D Arrays

## What are 2D Arrays?

A 2D array, also known as a multi-dimensional array, is an array where each element is itself an array. This structure is particularly useful for organizing data in a grid or matrix format, with rows and columns.

---

## Declaring and Initializing 2D Arrays

You can declare and initialize a 2D array in several ways.

### Direct Initialization

You can directly provide all the elements when declaring the array. This is often done by nesting curly braces `{}` to represent each inner array (row).

```java
String[][] groceries = {
    {"apple", "orange", "banana"},       // Row 0
    {"potato", "onion", "carrot"},       // Row 1
    {"chicken", "pork", "beef", "fish"}  // Row 2
};
```

In this example:
- `groceries` is a 2D array of strings.
- It has 3 rows.
- Row 0 has 3 columns.
- Row 1 has 3 columns.
- Row 2 has 4 columns.

### Initializing with Dimensions

You can declare a 2D array by specifying its dimensions, and then populate it later.

```java
char[][] telephone = new char[4][3]; // A 2D array with 4 rows and 3 columns
```

You can then assign values to individual elements.

```java
telephone[0][0] = '1';
telephone[0][1] = '2';
telephone[0][2] = '3';
// and so on...
```

It's also possible to initialize a 2D array with specific dimensions and then provide the values:

```java
char[][] telephone = {
    {'1', '2', '3'},
    {'4', '5', '6'},
    {'7', '8', '9'},
    {'*', '0', '#'}
};
```

## Accessing and Modifying Elements

To access or modify an element in a 2D array, you need to use two indices: the first for the row and the second for the column. Indices are zero-based.

```
arrayName[rowIndex][columnIndex]
```

### Example:

Consider the `groceries` array:

```java
String[][] groceries = {
    {"apple", "orange", "banana"},
    {"potato", "onion", "carrot"},
    {"chicken", "pork", "beef", "fish"}
};
```

- To access "apple", you would use `groceries[0][0]`.
- To access "onion", you would use `groceries[1][1]`.
- To access "fish", you would use `groceries[2][3]`.

To modify an element, you assign a new value to its specific index:

```java
// Change "potato" to "celery"
groceries[1][0] = "celery";

// Change "pork" to "eggs"
groceries[2][1] = "eggs";
```

After these modifications, the `groceries` array would look like this:

```java
{
    {"apple", "orange", "banana"},
    {"celery", "onion", "carrot"},
    {"chicken", "eggs", "beef", "fish"}
}
```

## Iterating Through 2D Arrays

To process all elements in a 2D array, you typically use nested loops.

### Using Nested Enhanced For Loops

This is a concise way to iterate through all elements. The outer loop iterates through each inner array (row), and the inner loop iterates through each element within that inner array.

```java
String[][] groceries = {
    {"apple", "orange", "banana"},
    {"potato", "onion", "carrot"},
    {"chicken", "pork", "beef", "fish"}
};

for (String[] row : groceries) { // Outer loop iterates through each String array (row)
    for (String food : row) {   // Inner loop iterates through each String element in the current row
        System.out.print(food + " ");
    }
    System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after printing all elements in a row
}
```

**Output:**
```
apple orange banana
potato onion carrot
chicken pork beef fish
```

### Using Nested Traditional For Loops

This method gives you more control over the indices.

```java
char[][] telephone = {
    {'1', '2', '3'},
    {'4', '5', '6'},
    {'7', '8', '9'},
    {'*', '0', '#'}
};

for (int i = 0; i < telephone.length; i++) { // Outer loop for rows
    for (int j = 0; j < telephone[i].length; j++) { // Inner loop for columns in the current row
        System.out.print(telephone[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println(); // Move to the next line after printing all elements in a row
}
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
* 0 #
```

- `telephone.length` gives the number of rows.
- `telephone[i].length` gives the number of columns in the current row `i`.

## Key Concepts

1. **Matrix of Data:** 2D arrays are ideal for representing tabular data, like spreadsheets or game boards.
2. **Array of Arrays:** Fundamentally, a 2D array is an array where each element is another array.
3. **Rows and Columns:** The first index typically refers to the row, and the second index refers to the column.
4. **Jagged Arrays:** In Java, inner arrays of a 2D array do not have to be the same length. This is known as a jagged array. The `groceries` example demonstrates this, as the third row has one more element than the first two.

# 2D Array Activities

## Activity 1: Classroom Seating Chart
Create a classroom seating chart management system using 2D arrays:

**Requirements:**
1. **Seat Representation:**
   - Use a 2D array to represent rows and columns of seats
   - Each seat can be: empty, occupied, or reserved
   - Store student names in occupied seats

2. **Features to Implement:**
   - Display seating chart with visual indicators
   - Assign student to specific seat
   - Find student by name and show their seat
   - Swap seats between two students
   - Calculate attendance percentage

3. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Find empty seats next to each other (for group work)
   - Rearrange seats alphabetically or by grade
   - Generate random seating arrangement

};

// Color image (3x3 with RGB values)
int[][][] colorImage = {
    {{255,0,0}, {0,255,0}, {0,0,255}},
    {{255,255,0}, {255,0,255}, {0,255,255}},
