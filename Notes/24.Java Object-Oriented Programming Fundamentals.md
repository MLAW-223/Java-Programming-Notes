# Java Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals

## What is an Object?
An object in programming is a representation of a real-world entity. It possesses two key characteristics:

**Attributes:** These are the data that an object holds. Think of them as the properties or characteristics of the object.

**Methods:** These are the actions that an object can perform. They define the behavior of the object.

Objects are considered reference data types. The data for an object is stored in a memory location known as the Heap.

### Example: Person Object
**Attributes:**
- Name (e.g., String)
- Age (e.g., integer)
- Height (e.g., double)
- Weight (e.g., double)

**Methods:**
- Eat()
- Sleep()

### Example: Car Object (from video)
**Attributes:**
- make (e.g., "Ford")
- model (e.g., "Mustang")
- year (e.g., 2025)
- price (e.g., $58000.99)
- isRunning (e.g., boolean - true/false)

**Methods:**
- start(): Sets isRunning to true and prints "You start the engine"
- stop(): Sets isRunning to false and prints "You stop the engine"
- drive(): Prints "You drive the [model]"
- brake(): Prints "You brake the [model]"

## Classes as Blueprints
A Class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) that all objects of that class will have.

## Defining a Class
To define a class, you specify its attributes and methods.

```java
public class Car { // Declares a class named Car

    // Attributes (instance variables)
    String make = "Ford";
    String model = "Mustang";
    int year = 2025;
    double price = 58000.99;
    boolean isRunning = false;

    // Methods
    void start(){
        isRunning = true;
        System.out.println("You start the engine");
    }

    void stop(){
        isRunning = false;
        System.out.println("You stop the engine");
    }

    void drive(){
        System.out.println("You drive the " + model);
    }

    void brake(){
        System.out.println("You brake the " + model);
    }
}
```

## Creating and Using Objects

### Instantiating an Object
To create an object from a class, you use the `new` keyword. This process is called instantiation.

```java
// Syntax: ClassName objectName = new ClassName();

Car myCar = new Car(); // Creates a new Car object named myCar
```

### Accessing Attributes
You use the dot operator (.) to access the attributes (and methods) of an object.

```java
// To print the make of the myCar object:
System.out.println(myCar.make); // Output: Ford

// To print the year of the myCar object:
System.out.println(myCar.year); // Output: 2025
```

### Modifying Attributes
You can change the values of an object's attributes.

```java
// Initially, the car is not running
System.out.println(myCar.isRunning); // Output: false

// Start the car
myCar.start();
System.out.println(myCar.isRunning); // Output: true

// Stop the car
myCar.stop();
System.out.println(myCar.isRunning); // Output: false
```

### Calling Methods
You use the dot operator to call the methods defined within a class on an object.

```java
myCar.drive(); // Output: You drive the Mustang
myCar.brake(); // Output: You brake the Mustang
```

## The Dot Operator
The dot operator (.) is crucial for interacting with objects. It allows you to:

1. Access an object's attributes
2. Call an object's methods

## Limitations of Basic Classes
When you define a class with fixed initial values for its attributes, all objects created from that class will have the same initial state.

```java
// Creating a second car object
Car anotherCar = new Car();

// Both myCar and anotherCar will initially have the same make and model:
System.out.println(myCar.make + " " + myCar.model); // Output: Ford Mustang
System.out.println(anotherCar.make + " " + anotherCar.model); // Output: Ford Mustang
```

This is where **Constructors** become important, allowing for the creation of unique objects with customizable attributes.

## Important Concepts in OOP

### 1. Encapsulation
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), often hiding internal details.

### 2. Instance Variables vs Local Variables
- **Instance Variables:** Declared inside a class but outside any method. They belong to objects.
- **Local Variables:** Declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks. They exist only during the execution of that code block.

### 3. The `this` Keyword
Used to refer to the current object. It helps distinguish between instance variables and parameters with the same name.

### 4. Memory Allocation
- **Stack:** Stores primitive types and object references
- **Heap:** Stores objects and their data

### 5. Null Objects
An object reference that doesn't point to any object in memory will have the value `null`. Trying to access methods or attributes of a null object causes a `NullPointerException`.

## Best Practices
1. **Class Naming:** Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., Car, Student, BankAccount)
2. **Method Naming:** Use camelCase for method names (e.g., startEngine(), calculateTotal())
3. **Variable Naming:** Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
4. **Access Modifiers:** Use appropriate access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to class members

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Forgetting to use `new` when creating objects
2. Trying to access instance variables or methods without an object instance
3. Confusing class variables with instance variables
4. Not handling null objects properly

## Activities

### Activity 1: Create a Book Class
Create a `Book` class with the following:
1. **Attributes:** title, author, ISBN, pageCount, isBorrowed (boolean)
2. **Methods:**
   - `borrowBook()`: Sets isBorrowed to true
   - `returnBook()`: Sets isBorrowed to false
   - `displayDetails()`: Prints all book details
3. Create 3 different Book objects and test all methods
4. Print the details of each book before and after borrowing/returning

### Activity 2: Bank Account System
Create a `BankAccount` class with:
1. **Attributes:** accountNumber, accountHolder, balance
2. **Methods:**
   - `deposit(amount)`: Adds amount to balance
   - `withdraw(amount)`: Subtracts amount from balance (check if sufficient funds)
   - `checkBalance()`: Returns current balance
   - `displayAccountInfo()`: Prints account details
3. Create at least 2 bank account objects
4. Perform multiple deposit and withdrawal operations
5. Test the withdrawal method with insufficient funds

### Activity 3: Student Management System
Create a `Student` class with:
1. **Attributes:** studentID, name, age, grade, courses (array of strings)
2. **Methods:**
   - `addCourse(courseName)`: Adds a course to the student's courses
   - `removeCourse(courseName)`: Removes a course if it exists
   - `calculateAverageGrade()`: Returns the average of grades (simplified)
   - `displayStudentInfo()`: Prints all student information including courses
3. Create 3 student objects with different attributes
4. Add/remove courses for each student
5. Display updated information after each operation
