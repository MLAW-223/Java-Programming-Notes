# Reading Files with Java

## Introduction to File Reading in Java
Java provides several ways to read files. The video focuses on three popular options:

**BufferedReader + FileReader:** Ideal for reading text files line by line. `BufferedReader` enhances efficiency by buffering input, while `FileReader` handles the actual reading from the file.

**FileInputStream:** Best suited for reading binary files such as images or audio files.

**RandomAccessFile:** Useful when you need to read from or write to specific portions of a large file, allowing for non-sequential access.

This guide will primarily focus on the `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` combination, as demonstrated in the video.

## Using BufferedReader and FileReader
This method is excellent for processing text files one line at a time.

### Key Classes and Imports
**BufferedReader:** Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

**FileReader:** Convenience class for reading character files. It is designed for character streams.

**FileNotFoundException:** An exception thrown when an attempt to open the file denoted by a specified pathname has failed.

**IOException:** A general exception for input/output operations.

You will need to import these classes:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
```

### The try-with-resources Statement
The try-with-resources statement ensures that resources (like file streams) are automatically closed after use, even if exceptions occur. This is the recommended way to handle file operations in modern Java.

The basic structure looks like this:

```java
try (ResourceType resource = new ResourceType(...)) {
    // Code to read from the resource
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Handle exceptions
}
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Define the File Path:** Create a `String` variable to hold the absolute path to your text file. Remember to use double backslashes (`\\`) in Windows paths or forward slashes (`/`) for cross-platform compatibility.
   ```java
   String filePath = "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\test.txt"; // Example Windows path
   // String filePath = "/Users/user/Desktop/test.txt"; // Example macOS/Linux path
   ```

2. **Instantiate BufferedReader and FileReader within try-with-resources:**
   ```java
   try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
       // ... reading logic here ...
   } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
       System.out.println("Could not locate file");
   } catch (IOException e) {
       System.out.println("Something went wrong");
   }
   ```
   - A `FileReader` object is created, pointing to the `filePath`.
   - This `FileReader` object is then passed into the constructor of a `BufferedReader` object.
   - The `BufferedReader` is declared within the parentheses of the try-with-resources statement, ensuring it will be closed automatically.

3. **Read the File Line by Line:** Use a `while` loop with the `readLine()` method of `BufferedReader`.
   - The `readLine()` method reads a line of text. It returns the line as a `String`, or `null` if the end of the file has been reached.
   - The loop continues as long as `readLine()` does not return `null`.
   ```java
   String line;
   while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
       System.out.println(line); // Process or print the line
   }
   ```

### Handling Exceptions
**FileNotFoundException:** Catches the specific error if the file specified by `filePath` does not exist or cannot be accessed.

**IOException:** Acts as a general catch-all for other input/output errors that might occur during the file reading process.

## Example Code Walkthrough
Let's assume you have a file named `test.txt` on your desktop with the following content:
```
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Java is fun
```

Here's the Java code to read and print this file:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileReadExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Replace with the actual path to your file
        String filePath = "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\test.txt";

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {

            String line;
            System.out.println("--- Reading file content ---");
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            System.out.println("--- End of file ---");

        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: The file was not found at the specified path.");
            // e.printStackTrace(); // Uncomment for more detailed error information
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: An I/O error occurred while reading the file.");
            // e.printStackTrace(); // Uncomment for more detailed error information
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Execution:
1. The `filePath` variable is set to the location of `test.txt`.
2. The try-with-resources block is entered. A `BufferedReader` is created, wrapping a `FileReader` initialized with `filePath`.
3. The `while` loop starts:
   - `reader.readLine()` reads "Roses are red". This string is assigned to the `line` variable. Since it's not `null`, the loop body executes.
   - `System.out.println(line)` prints "Roses are red".
   - `reader.readLine()` reads "Violets are blue". This is assigned to `line`. Not `null`, so the loop continues.
   - `System.out.println(line)` prints "Violets are blue".
   - `reader.readLine()` reads "Java is fun". This is assigned to `line`. Not `null`, so the loop continues.
   - `System.out.println(line)` prints "Java is fun".
   - `reader.readLine()` attempts to read again. Since there are no more lines, it returns `null`.
4. The condition `(line = reader.readLine()) != null` becomes `null != null`, which is `false`. The loop terminates.
5. The try-with-resources block finishes, and the `BufferedReader` is automatically closed.

If the file existed and was read successfully, the output would be:
```
--- Reading file content ---
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Java is fun
--- End of file ---
```

If `test.txt` did not exist at the specified `filePath`, the `FileNotFoundException` would be caught, and the message "Error: The file was not found at the specified path." would be printed to the error stream.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Word Counter
Create a program that reads a text file and counts:
1. Total number of lines in the file
2. Total number of words in the file
3. Number of times a specific word (entered by user) appears
Handle file not found and IO exceptions appropriately.

### Activity 2: File Analyzer
Create a file analyzer that reads a text file and displays:
1. The longest line in the file
2. The shortest line in the file
3. Average number of words per line
4. All lines that contain a user-specified search term
Use try-with-resources and proper exception handling.

### Activity 3: Data Parser
Create a program that reads a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file with the following format:
```
John Doe,25,Engineer
Jane Smith,30,Doctor
Bob Johnson,28,Teacher
```
Parse each line and create `Person` objects with name, age, and occupation fields. Display all parsed records and calculate the average age. Handle malformed lines and missing files appropriately.
