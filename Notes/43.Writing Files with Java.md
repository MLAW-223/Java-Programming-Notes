# Writing Files with Java

## Introduction to File Writing in Java
Java provides several ways to write data to files. The choice of method often depends on the type and size of the data being written. This guide focuses on `FileWriter`, a common and straightforward option for text files.

## Core Concepts and Classes

### File Writing Options
Java offers several primary options for writing files:

**FileWriter:** Suitable for small to medium-sized text files. It's the simplest to use for basic text writing.

**BufferedWriter:** Offers better performance when writing large amounts of text. It buffers output, reducing the number of actual write operations to the file.

**PrintWriter:** Ideal for writing structured data, such as reports or log files. It provides convenient methods for writing primitive data types and formatted strings.

**FileOutputStream:** The best choice for writing binary files (e.g., images, audio files). It deals with raw bytes rather than characters.

This guide primarily focuses on `FileWriter` as demonstrated in the video.

### The FileWriter Class
The `FileWriter` class is used to write character-based files.

**Key Features:**
- It writes text data character by character or as strings.
- It can be used to create new files or overwrite existing ones.

## Handling Exceptions
File operations are prone to errors (e.g., the file path might not exist, or there might be permission issues). Therefore, it's crucial to handle potential exceptions.

**try-catch Block:** This is essential for enclosing file operations.

**try-with-resources:** A modern Java feature that automatically closes resources (like `FileWriter`) when they are no longer needed, even if exceptions occur. This simplifies resource management and prevents leaks.

### Common Exceptions
**FileNotFoundException:** Thrown when a specified file path cannot be found or accessed.

**IOException:** A general exception for input/output errors. This can cover a wide range of issues during file operations, including writing problems.

## Writing a File with FileWriter

### Basic Syntax
The `FileWriter` is instantiated with a file path. The `write()` method is then used to write content to the file.

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException; // Import for specific exception handling

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String filePath = "test.txt";
        String textContent = "This is some text to write to the file.";

        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
            writer.write(textContent);
            System.out.println("File has been written successfully.");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Could not locate the file path.");
            e.printStackTrace(); // Good practice to print the stack trace for debugging
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Could not write to the file.");
            e.printStackTrace(); // Good practice to print the stack trace for debugging
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **`import java.io.FileWriter;`:** Imports the necessary class for writing files.
2. **`import java.io.IOException;`:** Imports the general I/O exception class.
3. **`import java.io.FileNotFoundException;`:** Imports the exception for when a file isn't found.
4. **`String filePath = "test.txt";`:** Defines the name of the file to be created or written to. By default, this will be in the project's root or source directory.
5. **`String textContent = "...";`:** Stores the text data that will be written to the file.
6. **`try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath))`:** This is the try-with-resources statement.
   - It creates a `FileWriter` object associated with `filePath`.
   - The `FileWriter` will automatically be closed when the `try` block finishes, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
7. **`writer.write(textContent);`:** Writes the content of the `textContent` string to the file.
8. **`System.out.println("File has been written successfully.");`:** A confirmation message printed if the write operation completes without errors.
9. **`catch (FileNotFoundException e):`** Catches the specific exception if the file path is invalid or inaccessible.
10. **`catch (IOException e):`** Catches any other I/O-related errors during the writing process.

### File Location
**Relative Path:** If you provide just a file name (e.g., "test.txt"), the file will typically be created in the project's root directory or the directory where the Java program is executed from.

**Absolute Path:** You can specify a full path to a specific location on your file system (e.g., "C:/Users/YourUser/Desktop/test.txt" or "/home/youruser/documents/test.txt").

**Important:** When specifying absolute paths in Java strings, you often need to use double backslashes (`\\`) on Windows to escape the backslash character, or use forward slashes (`/`) which are generally more cross-platform compatible. For example: `"C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Desktop\\test.txt"` or `"C:/Users/YourUser/Desktop/test.txt"`.

### Handling Specific Exceptions
It's best practice to catch more specific exceptions before general ones.

```java
try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
    writer.write(textContent);
    System.out.println("File has been written");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    // This catch block will handle cases where the path is invalid
    System.out.println("Could not locate file location");
} catch (IOException e) {
    // This catch block will handle other general I/O errors
    System.out.println("Could not write file");
}
```

## Advanced FileWriter Usage

### Using Variables for File Path and Content
For better organization, you can store the file path and text content in separate String variables.

```java
String filePath = "my_document.txt";
String fileContent = "This is line one.\nThis is line two."; // \n for newline

try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
    writer.write(fileContent);
    System.out.println("File content written.");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

### Multi-line Strings
Java's "text blocks" (introduced in Java 15) allow for easier creation of multi-line strings using triple double quotes (`"""`).

```java
String filePath = "poem.txt";
String poemContent = """
Roses are Red
Violets are Blue
Java is Fun
And so are You!
"""; // The triple quotes define the start and end of the text block

try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(filePath)) {
    writer.write(poemContent);
    System.out.println("Poem written to file.");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("An error occurred: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Summary of FileWriter
- `FileWriter` is a good choice for writing text to files, especially for smaller to medium-sized content.
- Always use try-with-resources to ensure the file is properly closed.
- Handle `FileNotFoundException` and `IOException` to manage potential errors gracefully.
- Use variables for file paths and content for better code readability and maintainability.
- Leverage text blocks (`"""..."""`) for convenient multi-line string definitions.

## Activities

### Activity 1: User Data Logger
Create a program that asks the user for their name, age, and email, then writes this information to a file called "user_data.txt". Handle exceptions for file writing errors and ensure the file is properly closed.

### Activity 2: Shopping List Creator
Create a shopping list application that:
1. Asks the user how many items they want to add
2. Collects each item name
3. Writes the complete shopping list to a file "shopping_list.txt" with each item on a new line
4. Uses try-with-resources and proper exception handling

### Activity 3: Diary/Journal Entry
Create a simple diary application that:
1. Asks the user for a date and diary entry
2. Writes the entry to a file named with the date (e.g., "2024-01-15_diary.txt")
3. Appends new entries to existing date files (use `FileWriter(filePath, true)` for appending)
4. Includes proper exception handling for file operations
