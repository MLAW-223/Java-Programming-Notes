# User Input in Java

## Introduction to Scanners

To accept user input in Java, you need to use the Scanner class. This class is part of the java.util package, so you must import it at the beginning of your Java file.

```
import java.util.Scanner;
```

A Scanner object is created to read input from a source. For console input, you use System.in.

```
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

It is good practice to close the Scanner object when you are finished with it to prevent potential issues.

# User Input in Java - Practice Activities

## Activity 1: Scanner Method Matching
**Instructions:** Match each scenario with the appropriate Scanner method.

**Scenarios:**
1. A user needs to enter their full name (first and last)
2. A user needs to enter their age
3. A user needs to enter their GPA (like 3.75)
4. A user needs to answer yes/no to being a student
5. A user needs to enter a single word username
6. A user needs to enter a phone number with dashes

**Methods:**
A. `nextLine()`
B. `nextInt()`
C. `nextDouble()`
D. `nextBoolean()`
E. `next()`

**Questions:**
1. Which method(s) would you use for each scenario?
2. For scenario 6, why might `nextLine()` be better than `next()`?
3. What method would you use to read a single character (like 'A' or 'M')?
4. What's the main difference between `nextLine()` and `next()`?

## Activity 2: Debugging Input Problems
**Instructions:** Identify and fix the issues in the following code snippets.

**Snippet 1:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
        int age = input.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter your city: ");
        String city = input.next();
        
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("City: " + city);
    }
}
```

**Scenario:** User enters "25" then "New York". What will happen?

**Snippet 2:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter price: $");
        String price = scan.nextLine();
        
        System.out.print("Enter quantity: ");
        int quantity = scan.nextLine();
        
        double total = price * quantity;
        System.out.println("Total: $" + total);
    }
}
```

**Snippet 3:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Problem3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Are you a student? (yes/no): ");
        boolean student = sc.nextBoolean();
        
        System.out.print("Enter your GPA: ");
        double gpa = sc.nextDouble();
        
        System.out.println("Student status: " + student);
        System.out.println("GPA: " + gpa);
    }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. In Snippet 1, what problem might occur when the user enters "New York"?
2. In Snippet 2, what are the three main errors?
3. In Snippet 3, what will happen if the user enters "yes" instead of "true"?
4. How would you fix each snippet?

## Activity 3: Design a User Registration Form
**Instructions:** Plan the code for a user registration system that collects the following information. Write out the Java code structure (you don't need to write full working code, just the structure).

**Information to collect:**
1. Full name
2. Age
3. Email address
4. Student status (true/false)
5. Desired username (single word)
6. GPA (if student is true)

**Requirements:**
- Use appropriate variable types
- Handle the newline character issue
- Include clear prompts for the user
- Display all collected information at the end

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What Scanner methods will you use for each piece of information?
2. Where will you need to add `scanner.nextLine()` to consume leftover newlines?
3. How will you handle conditional input (only ask for GPA if user is a student)?
4. What would the final output look like with sample data?

**Sample Output Structure:**
```
=== Registration Complete ===
Name: [name]
Age: [age]
Email: [email]
Student: [true/false]
Username: [username]
GPA: [gpa or "N/A"]
```

**Challenge:** Add phone number collection. What type would you use and why?
scanner.close();
```

## Reading Different Data Types

The Scanner class provides methods to read various data types from the user.

### Reading Strings

- `scanner.nextLine()`: Reads the entire line of text entered by the user, including spaces. This is useful for reading names or any input that might contain spaces.

- `scanner.next()`: Reads a single word (token) of text, stopping at the first whitespace character.

**Example:**

```
System.out.print("Enter your name: "); // Using print to keep the prompt and input on the same line
String name = scanner.nextLine();
System.out.println("Hello " + name);
```

---

### Reading Integers

- `scanner.nextInt()`: Reads an integer value entered by the user.

**Example:**

```
System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt();
System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
```

---

### Reading Doubles

- `scanner.nextDouble()`: Reads a double-precision floating-point value entered by the user. This is used for numbers with decimal points.

**Example:**

```
System.out.print("What is your GPA: ");
double gpa = scanner.nextDouble();
System.out.println("Your GPA is: " + gpa);
```

---

### Reading Booleans

- `scanner.nextBoolean()`: Reads a boolean value (`true` or `false`) entered by the user.

**Example:**

```
System.out.print("Are you a student? (true/false): ");
boolean isStudent = scanner.nextBoolean();
if (isStudent) {
    System.out.println("You are enrolled in classes.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are NOT enrolled in classes.");
}
```

## Common Input Issue: Integer/Double followed by String

A common problem arises when you read a number (integer or double) and then immediately try to read a string using `nextLine()`. This is because the `nextInt()` or `nextDouble()` methods read the number but leave the newline character (from pressing Enter) in the input buffer. The subsequent `nextLine()` then reads this leftover newline character as an empty string.

### Problematic Scenario:

```
System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt(); // Reads the number, leaves newline in buffer

System.out.print("Enter your favorite color: ");
String color = scanner.nextLine(); // Reads the leftover newline as input

System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
System.out.println("You like the color " + color);
```

### Solution:

To fix this, after reading an integer or double, you need to consume the leftover newline character. You can do this by calling `scanner.nextLine()` once without assigning its result to a variable.

### Corrected Scenario:

```
System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
int age = scanner.nextInt();

scanner.nextLine(); // Consume the leftover newline character

System.out.print("Enter your favorite color: ");
String color = scanner.nextLine();

System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
System.out.println("You like the color " + color);
```

## Example: Calculating the Area of a Rectangle

This example demonstrates how to use the Scanner to get dimensions from the user and then perform a calculation.

### Problem: 
Calculate the area of a rectangle given its width and height.

### Steps:

1. Import the Scanner class.
2. Create a Scanner object.
3. Declare variables for width, height, and area (using double for potential decimal values).
4. Prompt the user to enter the width and read it.
5. Prompt the user to enter the height and read it.
6. Calculate the area using the formula: Area = Width × Height.
7. Print the calculated area.
8. Close the scanner.

### Code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RectangleArea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        double width;
        double height;
        double area;

        System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
        width = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the height of the rectangle: ");
        height = scanner.nextDouble();

        // Calculate the area
        area = width * height;

        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);

        // Optional: Displaying area with superscript for units
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + area + " units²"); // Using superscript for clarity

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Example Walkthrough:

1. The program starts.
2. A Scanner object is created.
3. Variables width, height, and area are declared.
4. The user is prompted: "Enter the width of the rectangle: "
5. User enters 5.5 and presses Enter. width becomes 5.5.
6. The user is prompted: "Enter the height of the rectangle: "
7. User enters 10.2 and presses Enter. height becomes 10.2.
8. The area is calculated: area = 5.5 × 10.2 = 56.1.
9. The program outputs: "The area of the rectangle is: 56.1"
10. The program outputs: "The area of the rectangle is: 56.1 units²"
11. The Scanner is closed.
