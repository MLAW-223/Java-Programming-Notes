# Java Arithmetic Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

Java provides several arithmetic operators to perform mathematical calculations. These operators work with numeric data types.

---

## Basic Arithmetic Operators

1. **Addition (+):** Adds two operands.
   ```
   Example: int z = x + y;
   ```

2. **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   ```
   Example: z = x - y;
   ```

3. **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two operands.
   ```
   Example: z = x * y;
   ```

4. **Division (/):** Divides the first operand by the second.
   - **Integer Division:** When both operands are integers, the result will also be an integer, truncating any decimal part. For example, `10 / 3` results in `3`, not `3.33...`.
   ```
   Example: z = x / y;
   ```

5. **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of a division operation.
   ```
   Example: z = x % y;
   ```
   - **Use Case:** Useful for determining if a number is even or odd (a number modulo 2 will be 0 if even, 1 if odd) or for calculations involving cycles (like time or calendar dates).

## Augmented Assignment Operators

These operators provide a shorthand way to update a variable with the result of an operation performed on itself. They combine an arithmetic operator with the assignment operator (=).

1. **Addition Assignment (+=):** Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x + y;`
   ```
   Example: x += y;
   ```

2. **Subtraction Assignment (-=):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x - y;`
   ```
   Example: x -= y;
   ```

3. **Multiplication Assignment (*=):** Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x * y;`
   ```
   Example: x *= y;
   ```

4. **Division Assignment (/=):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x / y;`
   ```
   Example: x /= y;
   ```

5. **Modulus Assignment (%=):** Computes the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x % y;`
   ```
   Example: x %= y;
   ```

## Increment and Decrement Operators

These operators are used to increase or decrease a variable's value by exactly one. They are frequently used in looping structures.

1. **Increment (++):** Increases the value of a variable by 1.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x + 1;` or `x += 1;`
   ```
   Example: x++;
   ```

2. **Decrement (--):** Decreases the value of a variable by 1.
   - Shorthand for: `x = x - 1;` or `x -= 1;`
   ```
   Example: x--;
   ```

**Note on ++ and --:** These operators can be used in two ways:
- **Postfix (e.g., x++):** The expression is evaluated first using the original value of x, and then x is incremented.
- **Prefix (e.g., ++x):** x is incremented first, and then the expression is evaluated using the new value of x. The video primarily demonstrates the postfix version in the context of simple variable updates.

## Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

When an expression contains multiple arithmetic operators, Java follows a specific order of operations to determine the result. This order is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS.

1. **Parentheses**
2. **Exponents**
3. **Multiplication and Division** (evaluated from left to right)
4. **Addition and Subtraction** (evaluated from left to right)

### Example Calculation:

Consider the expression: `double result = 3 + 4 * (7 - 5) / 2.0;`

1. **Parentheses:** Evaluate `(7 - 5)`.
   - `7 - 5 = 2`
   - The expression becomes: `double result = 3 + 4 * 2 / 2.0;`

2. **Exponents:** There are no exponents in this expression.

3. **Multiplication and Division** (from left to right):
   - First, perform multiplication: `4 * 2 = 8`
   - The expression becomes: `double result = 3 + 8 / 2.0;`
   - Next, perform division: `8 / 2.0 = 4.0` (Note: Using `2.0` ensures floating-point division, retaining the decimal part).
   - The expression becomes: `double result = 3 + 4.0;`

4. **Addition and Subtraction** (from left to right):
   - Perform addition: `3 + 4.0 = 7.0`
   - The expression becomes: `double result = 7.0;`

Therefore, `result` will hold the value `7.0`.

---

**Important Note on Integer Division:** As mentioned earlier, if all operands in a division operation are integers, the result will be an integer, and any fractional part will be discarded. Using at least one floating-point number (like `2.0` in the example) in a division operation will result in floating-point division, preserving the decimal part. This concept is further explored in "type casting," which is discussed in other learning materials.
