# Searching Arrays in Java

## Introduction to Linear Search
Linear search is a fundamental algorithm used to find a specific element (the "target") within an array. It works by sequentially checking each element of the array until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.

## Key Concepts and Components
**Array:** A data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.

**Target:** The specific value or element that you are searching for within the array.

**Iteration:** The process of going through each element of the array one by one. This is typically done using a loop.

**Comparison:** At each step of the iteration, the current array element is compared to the target value.

**Match Found:** If the current element equals the target, the search is successful. The index of the found element is often recorded.

**No Match Found:** If the loop completes without finding the target, it means the target is not present in the array.

## Implementing Linear Search with Integers

### Steps:
1. **Declare and Initialize an Array:** Create an array of integers and populate it with values.
2. **Declare and Initialize a Target Variable:** Create an integer variable to hold the value you are searching for.
3. **Use a for loop:** Iterate through the array from the first element (index 0) to the last element.
   - The loop condition should check if the current index (i) is less than the array's length.
   - Increment the index (i++) in each iteration.
4. **Check for a Match:** Inside the loop, use an if statement to compare the target with the current array element (numbers[i]).
   - For primitive types like int, use the equality operator (==).
5. **Handle a Found Element:**
   - If a match is found, you can print a message indicating the element was found and its index (i).
   - Use a break statement to exit the loop immediately, as further searching is unnecessary.
   - Optionally, use a boolean flag (e.g., isFound) to track if the element has been found. Set it to true when a match occurs.
6. **Handle an Element Not Found:**
   - After the loop finishes, check the boolean flag. If isFound is still false, it means the target was not present in the array.
   - Print a message indicating that the element was not found.

### Example (Integers):
```java
// Declare and initialize an array of integers
int[] numbers = {5, 8, 2, 10, 3, 7, 1};

// Declare and initialize the target integer
int target = 2;

// Boolean flag to track if the target is found
boolean isFound = false;

// Iterate through the array
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    // Check if the current element matches the target
    if (target == numbers[i]) {
        System.out.println("Element found at index " + i);
        isFound = true; // Mark as found
        break; // Exit the loop
    }
}

// Check if the element was not found after the loop
if (!isFound) {
    System.out.println("Element not found in the array.");
}
```

**Output for target = 2:** Element found at index 2  
**Output for target = 9:** Element not found in the array.

## Implementing Linear Search with Strings
When searching through an array of String objects, the comparison logic needs to be adjusted.

### Key Differences for Strings:
**Reference Data Types:** Strings in Java are reference data types. This means variables store a reference (memory address) to the string object, not the string's actual characters directly.

**Equality Operator (==):** Using == with strings compares their memory addresses. This will only be true if both variables refer to the exact same string object in memory, which is often not the case even if the strings contain the same characters.

**.equals() Method:** To compare the actual content (characters) of two strings, you must use the .equals() method.

### Steps:
1. **Declare and Initialize a String Array:** Create an array of String objects.
2. **Declare and Initialize a Target String:** Create a String variable for the target.
3. **Use a for loop:** Similar to integer arrays, iterate through the string array.
4. **Check for a Match:** Inside the loop, use an if statement to compare the target with the current array element (fruits[i]).
   - Use the .equals() method: target.equals(fruits[i]) or fruits[i].equals(target).
5. **Handle Found/Not Found:** The logic for handling found and not-found elements (using a boolean flag, break, and post-loop checks) remains the same as with integer arrays.

### Example (Strings):
```java
// Declare and initialize an array of strings
String[] fruits = {"apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"};

// Declare and initialize the target string
String targetFruit = "banana";

// Boolean flag to track if the target is found
boolean isFruitFound = false;

// Iterate through the array
for (int i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    // Check if the current element matches the target using .equals()
    if (targetFruit.equals(fruits[i])) {
        System.out.println("Fruit found at index " + i);
        isFruitFound = true; // Mark as found
        break; // Exit the loop
    }
}

// Check if the element was not found after the loop
if (!isFruitFound) {
    System.out.println("Fruit not found in the array.");
}
```

**Output for targetFruit = "banana":** Fruit found at index 2  
**Output for targetFruit = "kiwi":** Fruit not found in the array.

## Incorporating User Input with Scanner
You can make the search interactive by allowing the user to input the target value.

### Steps:
1. **Import the Scanner class:** Add import java.util.Scanner; at the beginning of your program.
2. **Create a Scanner object:** Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
3. **Prompt the user:** Use System.out.print() or System.out.println() to ask the user for input.
4. **Read user input:**
   - For integers: int target = scanner.nextInt();
   - For strings: String target = scanner.nextLine(); (Note: nextInt() leaves a newline character in the buffer, so if you mix nextInt() and nextLine(), you might need to consume the newline, e.g., by calling scanner.nextLine() after nextInt()). Using nextLine() for string input is generally more straightforward.
5. **Perform the search:** Use the read user input as the target in your linear search logic.
6. **Close the Scanner:** It's good practice to close the scanner when you are finished with it to release system resources: scanner.close();

### Example (User Input for String Search):
```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Import the Scanner class

public class ArraySearch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize an array of strings
        String[] fruits = {"apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"};

        // Create a Scanner object to read user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter a fruit to search for
        System.out.print("Enter a fruit to search for: ");

        // Read the user's input as the target string
        String targetFruit = scanner.nextLine();

        // Boolean flag to track if the target is found
        boolean isFruitFound = false;

        // Iterate through the array
        for (int i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
            // Check if the current element matches the target using .equals()
            if (targetFruit.equals(fruits[i])) {
                System.out.println("Fruit found at index " + i);
                isFruitFound = true; // Mark as found
                break; // Exit the loop
            }
        }

        // Check if the element was not found after the loop
        if (!isFruitFound) {
            System.out.println("Fruit not found in the array.");
        }

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

**Example Interaction 1:**
```
Enter a fruit to search for: orange
Fruit found at index 1
```

**Example Interaction 2:**
```
Enter a fruit to search for: pineapple
Fruit not found in the array.
```

## Activities

### Activity 1: Integer Search Practice
Create a Java program that:
1. Declares an integer array with values: {15, 42, 8, 23, 56, 91, 34, 72}
2. Prompts the user to enter an integer to search for
3. Uses linear search to find the target integer
4. Displays whether the element was found and at which index, or if it was not found
5. Also displays how many comparisons were made during the search

### Activity 2: String Array Search
Create a Java program that:
1. Declares a string array with at least 8 names of countries
2. Prompts the user to enter a country name to search for
3. Uses linear search with the .equals() method (case-sensitive search)
4. Modifies the program to perform a case-insensitive search (using .equalsIgnoreCase())
5. Displays whether the country was found and at which index

### Activity 3: Enhanced Linear Search
Create a Java program that:
1. Generates an array of 20 random integers between 1 and 100
2. Prompts the user to enter a target number
3. Searches for the target using linear search
4. Instead of stopping at the first occurrence, finds ALL occurrences of the target
5. Displays all indices where the target was found, or a message if it wasn't found
6. Also displays the count of occurrences found
