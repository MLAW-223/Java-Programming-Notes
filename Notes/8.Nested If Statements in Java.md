# Nested If Statements in Java

## Introduction to Nested If Statements

Nested if statements involve placing one or more if statements inside another if or else block. This allows for more complex decision-making processes by checking multiple conditions sequentially. If the outer if condition is true, the inner if statement is then evaluated.

## Basic Structure

The general structure of a nested if statement can be visualized as follows:

```java
if (outerCondition) {
    // Code to execute if outerCondition is true

    if (innerCondition) {
        // Code to execute if outerCondition AND innerCondition are true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if outerCondition is true BUT innerCondition is false
    }
} else {
    // Code to execute if outerCondition is false

    if (anotherInnerCondition) {
        // Code to execute if outerCondition is false AND anotherInnerCondition is true
    } else {
        // Code to execute if outerCondition is false AND anotherInnerCondition is false
    }
}
```

## Example: Movie Ticket Discounts

The provided Java code demonstrates a practical application of nested if statements for calculating movie ticket prices with various discounts.

### Scenario:

1. **Student Discount**: 10% off if the person is a student.
2. **Senior Discount**: 20% off if the person is a senior (65 or older).
3. **Combined Discount**: If a person is both a student and a senior, they receive a combined discount of 30% (10% + 20%).

### Code Breakdown:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        boolean isStudent = true; // Example: Person is a student
        boolean isSenior = true;  // Example: Person is a senior
        double price = 9.99;     // Original ticket price

        if (isStudent) { // Check if the person is a student
            if (isSenior) { // If they are a student, check if they are also a senior
                System.out.println("You get a senior discount of 20%");
                System.out.println("You get a student discount of 10%");
                // Combined discount: 10% + 20% = 30% off
                // Price becomes 70% of original: 9.99 * (1 - 0.30) = 9.99 * 0.70
                price *= 0.7;
            } else { // If they are a student but not a senior
                System.out.println("You get a student discount of 10%");
                // Student discount: 10% off
                // Price becomes 90% of original: 9.99 * (1 - 0.10) = 9.99 * 0.90
                price *= 0.9;
            }
        } else { // If the person is not a student
            if (isSenior) { // Check if they are a senior
                System.out.println("You get a senior discount of 20%");
                // Senior discount: 20% off
                // Price becomes 80% of original: 9.99 * (1 - 0.20) = 9.99 * 0.80
                price *= 0.8;
            } else { // If they are neither a student nor a senior
                // No discount, price remains the same
                price *= 1; // This line is functionally redundant but aids visualization
            }
        }

        // Using printf to format the output to two decimal places
        System.out.printf("The price of a ticket is: $%.2f", price);
    }
}
```

### Calculation Example:

Let's trace the calculation when `isStudent` is `true` and `isSenior` is `true`, with an initial price of $9.99:

1. The outer `if (isStudent)` condition evaluates to `true`.
2. The code enters the first `if` block.
3. The inner `if (isSenior)` condition also evaluates to `true`.
4. The code enters the inner `if` block.
5. The messages "You get a senior discount of 20%" and "You get a student discount of 10%" are printed.
6. The price is updated: `price *= 0.7;`
   - This means `price = price * 0.7;`
   - `price = 9.99 * 0.7;`
   - `price = 6.993;`
7. The `System.out.printf` statement formats the price to two decimal places.
   - `%.2f` formats the `double` variable `price` to display with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

The final output will be:
```
You get a senior discount of 20%
You get a student discount of 10%
The price of a ticket is: $6.99
```

## Using printf for Formatting Output

The `System.out.printf()` method is useful for controlling the format of output, especially for floating-point numbers.

- `%.2f`: This format specifier indicates that a floating-point number (like a double) should be printed with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

## When to Use Nested If Statements

Nested if statements are valuable when:

1. You need to check a secondary condition only if a primary condition is met.
2. Your program's logic requires a sequence of dependent checks.
3. You want to avoid overly complex if-else if chains when conditions are not mutually exclusive but rather hierarchical.

# Nested If Statements Activities

## Activity 1: Job Application Filter

Create a program that filters job applicants based on multiple criteria:

**Requirements:**
1. Applicants must be at least 18 years old
2. If under 18, they must have parental consent
3. Must have either a high school diploma OR relevant work experience (3+ years)
4. Must pass a background check

**Your program should:**
- Use nested if statements to check these conditions in logical order
- Provide specific feedback about why an applicant was rejected
- Calculate the final decision: "Accepted", "Conditionally Accepted", or "Rejected"

**Sample scenarios to test:**
- 16-year-old with parental consent, diploma, clean background
- 25-year-old with experience but no diploma
- 17-year-old without parental consent but with diploma
- 30-year-old with diploma but failed background check

## Activity 2: Smart Home Security System

Design a smart home security system with nested conditions:

**Security Levels:**
1. **Home Mode** (family home):
   - Check if front door is locked
   - If windows are open, check if they're on the second floor or have sensors
   - If alarm is set, verify all family members are accounted for

2. **Away Mode** (vacation):
   - All doors and windows must be locked
   - Security cameras must be active
   - Lights should be on timer schedule
   - Notify if any motion is detected

3. **Sleep Mode** (nighttime):
   - Check if all bedroom doors are closed
   - Verify smoke detectors are working
   - If garage door is open, send alert

**Create a program that:**
- Asks the user which mode they want to activate
- Uses nested if statements to check all requirements for that mode
- Provides specific warnings about what needs to be fixed
- Confirms when security is properly set

## Activity 3: E-commerce Shipping Calculator

Create a shipping cost calculator with multiple nested conditions:

**Shipping Rules:**
1. **Domestic Shipping** (within country):
   - Standard: 3-5 days, $5.99
   - Express: 1-2 days, $12.99
   - Free shipping for orders over $50 (standard only)

2. **International Shipping**:
   - Check if destination country is available
   - Standard: 7-14 days, calculated by weight
   - Express: 3-5 days, calculated by weight + $15 fee
   - Additional fees for remote locations

3. **Special Items**:
   - Fragile items: +$5 handling fee
   - Large items: additional size-based fee
   - Hazardous materials: special restrictions apply

**Your program should:**
- Ask for destination, shipping speed, order total, item type
- Use nested if statements to calculate the total shipping cost
- Handle edge cases (e.g., free shipping doesn't apply to express)
- Display a detailed breakdown of all fees and restrictions
