# Composition in Programming

## What is Composition?
Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that represents a "part-of" relationship between objects. It allows for complex objects to be built from smaller, more manageable objects. Think of it as assembling a larger entity by combining its constituent parts.

**Key Idea:** An object has a relationship with another object.

**Example:** A Car object has an Engine object. The Engine is a part of the Car.

## Benefits of Composition
**Modularity:** Complex systems can be broken down into smaller, independent components (objects).

**Reusability:** Smaller objects can be reused across different parts of an application or in different applications.

**Maintainability:** Changes to one component (e.g., Engine) are less likely to affect other unrelated components, making the code easier to update and debug.

**Flexibility:** You can easily swap out different implementations of a component (e.g., using a different type of Engine) without altering the main object (Car) significantly.

## Implementing Composition in Java
The provided Java code demonstrates a practical implementation of composition.

**The Car Class**
The `Car` class is an example of a composite object. It contains an `Engine` object as one of its attributes.

**Attributes:**
- `String model`: Represents the model name of the car.
- `int year`: Represents the manufacturing year of the car.
- `Engine engine`: This is the key part of composition. The `Car` class has an `Engine` object.

**Constructor:**
```java
Car(String model, int year, String engineType) {
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    // Crucially, a new Engine object is created and assigned to the 'engine' attribute.
    this.engine = new Engine(engineType);
}
```
When a `Car` object is created, its `Engine` object is also created within the `Car`'s constructor. The `engineType` parameter is used to initialize the `Engine` object.

**Methods:**
```java
void start() {
    this.engine.start(); // Calls the start() method of the Engine object
    System.out.println("The " + this.model + " is running");
}
```
This method demonstrates how the `Car` object can utilize its `Engine` object.

**The Engine Class**
The `Engine` class represents a component that can be part of a larger object.

**Attributes:**
- `String type`: Represents the type of the engine (e.g., "V8", "Inline-4").

**Constructor:**
```java
Engine(String type) {
    this.type = type;
}
```
Initializes the type of the engine.

**Methods:**
```java
void start() {
    System.out.println("You start the " + this.type + " engine");
}
```
Simulates starting the engine.

## Example Walkthrough
Let's trace the execution of the `Main` class:

**Object Creation:**
```java
Car car = new Car("Corvette", 2025, "V8");
```
1. A new `Car` object is instantiated.
2. The `Car` constructor is called with "Corvette" for `model`, 2025 for `year`, and "V8" for `engineType`.
3. Inside the `Car` constructor:
   - `this.model` is set to "Corvette".
   - `this.year` is set to 2025.
   - `this.engine = new Engine("V8");` creates a new `Engine` object with its `type` attribute set to "V8" and assigns it to the `car` object's `engine` attribute.

**Accessing Attributes:**
```java
System.out.println(car.model);
System.out.println(car.year);
System.out.println(car.engine.type);
```
- `car.model` outputs `Corvette`.
- `car.year` outputs `2025`.
- `car.engine.type`: This demonstrates accessing an attribute of a composed object. We first access the `engine` object within the `car` object, and then we access the `type` attribute of that `Engine` object, which outputs `V8`.

**Calling Methods:**
```java
car.start();
```
1. The `start()` method of the `Car` object is called.
2. Inside `car.start()`:
   - `this.engine.start();` calls the `start()` method of the `Engine` object associated with the `car`. This prints: `You start the V8 engine`.
   - `System.out.println("The " + this.model + " is running");` prints: `The Corvette is running`.

**Output of the example:**
```
Corvette
2025
V8
You start the V8 engine
The Corvette is running
```

## The "Part-of" Relationship and Object Lifecycles
A key aspect of composition is that the composed object's lifecycle is often tied to the composite object. In the example, if the `car` object is deleted (or goes out of scope and is garbage collected), the `engine` object that is part of it is also effectively gone because it's no longer accessible. This reinforces the "part-of" relationship.

## Composition vs. Inheritance
It's important to distinguish composition from inheritance.

**Composition ("has-a" relationship):** An object has another object. Example: A Car has an Engine.

**Inheritance ("is-a" relationship):** A class is a type of another class. Example: A SportsCar is a Car.

Composition is generally preferred over inheritance when the relationship is not a strict "is-a" hierarchy, as it promotes greater flexibility and modularity.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Computer System Composition
Create a `Computer` class that is composed of `Processor`, `Memory`, and `Storage` objects. Each component class should have relevant attributes (e.g., `Processor` has `brand`, `speed`; `Memory` has `capacity`, `type`). The `Computer` class should have a method `showSpecs()` that displays all the components' details.

### Activity 2: House and Room Composition
Create a `House` class composed of multiple `Room` objects. Each `Room` should have a name, area, and purpose (e.g., "Bedroom", "Living Room"). The `House` class should have methods to add rooms, remove rooms, and calculate the total area of the house.

### Activity 3: Online Order Composition
Create an `Order` class composed of multiple `OrderItem` objects. Each `OrderItem` should represent a product with name, price, and quantity. The `Order` class should have methods to add items, calculate the total order amount, and display all items.
