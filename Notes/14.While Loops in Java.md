# While Loops in Java

## Introduction to While Loops

A while loop in Java is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Think of it as a way to "do this while that is true."

The basic syntax of a while loop is:

```java
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
```

The condition is a boolean expression that is evaluated **before** each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code inside the loop's curly braces is executed. After the code inside the loop finishes, the condition is checked again. This process repeats until the condition evaluates to `false`.

## Key Concepts and Examples

### Example 1: Ensuring User Input

One common use case for while loops is to ensure that a user provides valid input. The program will continue to prompt the user until a satisfactory input is received.

Consider a program that needs to get a user's name. If the user enters an empty name (just presses Enter), the program should ask again.

```java
String name = ""; // Initialize name to an empty string

while (name.isEmpty()) { // Loop continues as long as 'name' is empty
    System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
    name = scanner.nextLine(); // Read user input
}

System.out.println("Hello " + name); // Once a name is entered, the loop ends and this line executes
```

In this example, the loop `while (name.isEmpty())` will keep running as long as the `name` variable is empty. Only when the user enters some text and presses Enter will `name.isEmpty()` become `false`, allowing the loop to terminate and the "Hello" message to be printed.

### Infinite Loops

An infinite loop occurs when the condition in a while loop can never become `false`. This often happens if the variables involved in the condition are not updated within the loop in a way that would eventually lead to the condition becoming `false`.

```java
// DANGER: This is an infinite loop
while (1 == 1) {
    System.out.println("Help, I'm stuck in a loop!");
    // There is no code here to change the condition (1 == 1)
}
```

If you encounter an infinite loop, you typically need to force-stop your program (e.g., by pressing **Ctrl + C** in the terminal). It's crucial to ensure that your loop's condition will eventually evaluate to `false` to avoid this.

### Example 2: Quitting a Program

Another example demonstrates how a while loop can control program flow based on user input. A program might continue running until the user explicitly tells it to stop.

```java
String response = ""; // Initialize response

while (!response.equals("Q")) { // Loop continues as long as 'response' is NOT equal to "Q"
    System.out.print("Press Q to quit: ");
    response = scanner.next().toUpperCase(); // Read input and convert to uppercase
}

System.out.println("You have quit"); // Loop ends when response is "Q"
```

Here, the `!response.equals("Q")` condition means "while the response is not equal to 'Q'". The `toUpperCase()` method is used to make the comparison case-insensitive, so both 'q' and 'Q' will cause the loop to terminate.

### Example 3: Input Validation (Age)

This example shows how to use a while loop to re-prompt a user if they enter invalid data, such as a negative age.

```java
int age = 0; // Initialize age

System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
age = scanner.nextInt(); // Get initial age input

while (age < 0) { // Loop continues if age is negative
    System.out.println("Your age can't be negative.");
    System.out.print("Please enter your age again: ");
    age = scanner.nextInt(); // Re-prompt for age
}

System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old."); // Once a non-negative age is entered, the loop ends
```

In this scenario, if the user initially enters a negative number, the `while (age < 0)` condition is `true`. The loop body executes, printing an error message and asking for input again. This repeats until a non-negative number is entered, making the condition `false`. If the user enters a valid age (0 or greater) initially, the while loop's condition is `false` from the start, and the loop is skipped entirely.

## Do-While Loops

A **do-while loop** is a variation of the while loop. The key difference is that a do-while loop always executes its body **at least once** before checking the condition.

The syntax for a do-while loop is:

```java
do {
    // Code to be executed at least once
} while (condition); // Condition checked after the code block
```

### How it Works

1. The code block inside the `do` section is executed.
2. The condition is then evaluated.
3. If the condition is `true`, the loop repeats from step 1.
4. If the condition is `false`, the loop terminates, and execution continues after the `while (condition);` statement.

### Example 4: Age Validation with Do-While

Let's revisit the age validation example using a do-while loop.

```java
int age; // No initial assignment needed here for the do-while structure

do {
    System.out.print("Enter your age: ");
    age = scanner.nextInt(); // Read user input

    if (age < 0) { // Check if input is invalid
        System.out.println("Your age can't be negative.");
    }
} while (age < 0); // Loop continues as long as age is negative

System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");
```

In this do-while loop:

1. The prompt "Enter your age:" and `scanner.nextInt()` will **always** run at least once.
2. If the entered age is negative, the `if (age < 0)` block executes, printing the error message.
3. Then, the `while (age < 0)` condition is checked. If it's `true` (meaning age is still negative), the loop repeats.
4. If a non-negative age is entered, the `while (age < 0)` condition becomes `false`, and the loop terminates.

The main difference here is that the do-while loop guarantees the code inside the `do` block runs at least once, whereas a standard while loop might not execute its body at all if the condition is initially `false`.

### Example 5: Number in a Range with Do-While

This example shows how to use a do-while loop to ensure a number entered by the user falls within a specific range (e.g., between 1 and 10).

```java
int number;

do {
    System.out.print("Enter a number between 1 and 10: ");
    number = scanner.nextInt(); // Get input

    if (number < 1 || number > 10) { // Check if outside the valid range
        System.out.println("Invalid input. Please try again.");
    }
} while (number < 1 || number > 10); // Loop continues if the number is less than 1 OR greater than 10

System.out.println("You picked: " + number);
```

Here, the loop will continue to prompt the user until they enter a number that is not less than 1 AND not greater than 10 (i.e., a number between 1 and 10, inclusive). The code inside the `do` block is executed at least once.
