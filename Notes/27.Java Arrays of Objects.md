# Java Arrays of Objects

## Introduction to Arrays of Objects
An array of objects in Java is a collection of variables that each refer to an object of a specific class. This allows you to manage multiple instances of a class in an organized manner.

## Creating a Class for Objects
Before creating an array of objects, you need a class that defines the blueprint for those objects. Each object will have attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) defined by this class.

### Example: Car Class
The Car class has two attributes: model (String) and color (String). It also has a constructor to initialize these attributes and a drive() method to print a message about the car.

```java
public class Car {
    String model;
    String color;

    Car(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("You drive the " + this.color + " " + this.model);
    }
}
```

## Declaring and Initializing Arrays of Objects
There are several ways to declare and initialize an array of objects.

### 1. Declaring and then Initializing with `new`
You can declare an array and then allocate memory for it using the `new` keyword, specifying the size.

**Syntax:**
```java
DataType[] arrayName = new DataType[size];
```

**Example:**
```java
Car[] cars = new Car[3]; // Declares an array that can hold 3 Car objects
```

After declaration, you need to create individual Car objects and assign them to each element of the array.

**Example:**
```java
cars[0] = new Car("Mustang", "Red");
cars[1] = new Car("Corvette", "Blue");
cars[2] = new Car("Charger", "Yellow");
```

### 2. Array Literal Initialization (Combined Declaration and Initialization)
This is a more concise way to declare and initialize an array with objects in one step.

**Syntax:**
```java
DataType[] arrayName = { object1, object2, object3, ... };
```

**Example:**
```java
Car[] cars = {
    new Car("Mustang", "Red"),
    new Car("Corvette", "Blue"),
    new Car("Charger", "Yellow")
};
```

### 3. Array Literal with Anonymous Objects
You can create objects directly within the array literal without assigning them to separate variables first. These are called "anonymous objects."

**Syntax:**
```java
DataType[] arrayName = { new DataType(arg1, arg2, ...), new DataType(arg1, arg2, ...), ... };
```

**Example:**
```java
Car[] cars = {
    new Car("Mustang", "Red"),
    new Car("Corvette", "Blue"),
    new Car("Charger", "Yellow")
};
```

This is functionally the same as the previous example, but emphasizes that the `new Car(...)` expressions are creating objects directly for the array.

## Accessing and Modifying Objects in an Array
You can access individual objects in an array using their index (starting from 0) and then call their methods or modify their attributes.

**Accessing an Object:**
```java
Car firstCar = cars[0]; // Get the first Car object
```

**Accessing an Attribute:**
```java
String firstCarModel = cars[0].model; // Get the model of the first Car
```

**Calling a Method:**
```java
cars[0].drive(); // Call the drive() method on the first Car object
```

**Modifying an Attribute:**
```java
cars[0].color = "Black"; // Change the color of the first Car object
```

## Iterating Through Arrays of Objects
You can use loops to process all objects within an array.

### 1. Standard for Loop
This loop uses an index variable to access each element.

**Syntax:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++) {
    // Access element using arrayName[i]
    // Example: arrayName[i].someMethod();
}
```

**Example:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    cars[i].drive(); // Calls drive() on each car in the array
}
```

### 2. Enhanced for Loop (For-Each Loop)
This loop provides a more concise way to iterate over collections, including arrays. It iterates through each element directly without needing an index.

**Syntax:**
```java
for (DataType element : arrayName) {
    // 'element' refers to the current object in the iteration
    // Example: element.someMethod();
}
```

**Example:**
```java
for (Car car : cars) {
    car.drive(); // Calls drive() on each car in the array
}
```

**Modifying objects using an enhanced for loop:**
You can also modify the objects within an enhanced for loop.

```java
for (Car car : cars) {
    car.color = "Black"; // Changes the color of each car to black
}
```

## Example: Modifying and Then Displaying Cars
This example demonstrates how to create an array of Car objects, change their color using an enhanced for loop, and then display the updated information using another enhanced for loop.

**Code:**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // 1. Array Literal Initialization with Anonymous Objects
        Car[] cars = {
            new Car("Mustang", "Red"),
            new Car("Corvette", "Blue"),
            new Car("Charger", "Yellow")
        };

        // 2. Modify the color of each car to "black" using an enhanced for loop
        System.out.println("Changing all car colors to black...");
        for (Car car : cars) {
            car.color = "black";
        }

        // 3. Display the updated car information using another enhanced for loop
        System.out.println("Displaying updated car information:");
        for (Car car : cars) {
            car.drive();
        }
    }
}

// Car class definition (as shown previously)
class Car {
    String model;
    String color;

    Car(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
    }

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("You drive the " + this.color + " " + this.model);
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Changing all car colors to black...
Displaying updated car information:
You drive the black Mustang
You drive the black Corvette
You drive the black Charger
```

## Important Concepts

### 1. Null Elements in Object Arrays
When you create an array of objects, the elements are initially `null`. You must initialize each element before using it.

```java
Student[] students = new Student[5];
// students[0], students[1], etc. are all null initially

students[0] = new Student("Alice", 20); // Now students[0] points to a Student object
```

### 2. Multi-dimensional Arrays of Objects
You can create arrays of arrays of objects (2D, 3D, etc.).

```java
Car[][] carDealership = new Car[3][4]; // 3 floors, 4 cars per floor
carDealership[0][0] = new Car("Mustang", "Red");
```

### 3. Arrays of Different Object Types
All objects in an array must be of the same type or a subtype of the array's declared type.

```java
// Using inheritance
Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[3];
vehicles[0] = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
vehicles[1] = new Truck("Ford", "F-150");
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Initialize Arrays Properly
```java
// Good: Initialize with actual objects
Car[] cars = {
    new Car("Model1", "Red"),
    new Car("Model2", "Blue")
};

// Bad: Leave array elements as null (leads to NullPointerException)
Car[] cars = new Car[2];
// Need to initialize each element before use
cars[0] = new Car("Model1", "Red");
cars[1] = new Car("Model2", "Blue");
```

### 2. Use Enhanced For Loop for Read-Only Operations
```java
// Good for reading
for (Car car : cars) {
    System.out.println(car.model);
}

// Better for modifying
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    cars[i].model = "Updated " + cars[i].model;
}
```

### 3. Check for Null Before Accessing
```java
for (Car car : cars) {
    if (car != null) {
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

## Common Operations on Arrays of Objects

### 1. Searching
```java
public static Car findCarByModel(Car[] cars, String model) {
    for (Car car : cars) {
        if (car != null && car.model.equals(model)) {
            return car;
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 2. Filtering
```java
public static Car[] filterByColor(Car[] cars, String color) {
    List<Car> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Car car : cars) {
        if (car != null && car.color.equals(color)) {
            result.add(car);
        }
    }
    return result.toArray(new Car[0]);
}
```

### 3. Sorting
```java
// Using Arrays.sort() with Comparator
Arrays.sort(cars, new Comparator<Car>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(Car c1, Car c2) {
        return c1.model.compareTo(c2.model);
    }
});
```

### 4. Statistics
```java
public static double averagePrice(Car[] cars) {
    double total = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (Car car : cars) {
        if (car != null && car.price > 0) {
            total += car.price;
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count > 0 ? total / count : 0;
}
```

## Memory Considerations

### 1. Object References
```java
Car[] cars = new Car[1000]; // Only creates 1000 references (null pointers)
// Each Car object is created separately and takes additional memory
for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    cars[i] = new Car("Model " + i, "Color " + i);
}
```

### 2. Garbage Collection
When you set an array element to null or the array goes out of scope, the object may become eligible for garbage collection.

```java
cars[0] = null; // The Car object may be garbage collected
```
