# Java Aggregation

## What is Aggregation?
Aggregation in programming represents a "has-a" relationship between objects. This means that one object contains another object (or objects) as part of its structure. A key characteristic of aggregation is that the contained objects can exist independently of the container object.

## Core Concepts
**"Has-a" Relationship:** An object has other objects. For example, a Library object has Book objects.

**Independent Existence:** The contained objects (e.g., Books) can exist on their own, even if the container object (e.g., Library) is destroyed or removed. This is the primary differentiator from composition.

## Example Breakdown
The provided Java code demonstrates aggregation with `Book` and `Library` classes.

**The Book Class**
This class represents an individual book.

**Attributes:**
- `String title`: The title of the book.
- `int pages`: The number of pages in the book.

**Constructor:**
- `Book(String title, int pages)`: Initializes a new `Book` object with a given title and number of pages.

**Method:**
- `String displayInfo()`: Returns a string representation of the book's title and page count, formatted as "Title (Pages pages)".

```java
class Book {
    String title;
    int pages;

    Book(String title, int pages) {
        this.title = title;
        this.pages = pages;
    }

    String displayInfo() {
        return title + " (" + pages + " pages)";
    }
}
```

**The Library Class**
This class represents a library that contains multiple books.

**Attributes:**
- `String name`: The name of the library.
- `int year`: The year the library was established.
- `Book[] books`: An array to hold `Book` objects. This is where the aggregation is evident – the Library has an array of Books.

**Constructor:**
- `Library(String name, int year, Book[] books)`: Initializes a new `Library` object with a name, establishment year, and an array of `Book` objects.

**Method:**
- `void displayInfo()`: Prints the library's name and establishment year, followed by a list of all the books it contains by calling the `displayInfo()` method of each `Book` object in its `books` array.

```java
class Library {
    String name;
    int year;
    Book[] books;

    Library(String name, int year, Book[] books) {
        this.name = name;
        this.year = year;
        this.books = books;
    }

    void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Library: " + name);
        System.out.println("Established: " + year);
        System.out.println("Books available:");
        for (Book book : books) {
            System.out.println("- " + book.displayInfo());
        }
    }
}
```

**The Main Class (Demonstration)**
This class shows how to create and use the `Book` and `Library` objects to illustrate aggregation.

**Create Book Objects:**
Three `Book` objects (`book1`, `book2`, `book3`) are instantiated independently.
```java
Book book1 = new Book("The Fellow of the Ring", 423);
Book book2 = new Book("The Two Towers", 352);
Book book3 = new Book("The Return of the King", 416);
```

**Create a Book Array:**
An array named `books` is created to hold these `Book` objects.
```java
Book[] books = {book1, book2, book3};
```

**Create a Library Object:**
A `Library` object (`library`) is instantiated, and the `books` array is passed into its constructor. This establishes the "has-a" relationship.
```java
Library library = new Library("NYC Public Library", 1897, books);
```

**Display Library Information:**
The `displayInfo()` method of the `library` object is called. This method then iterates through its `books` array and calls `displayInfo()` on each `Book`, demonstrating that the `Library` object utilizes its contained `Book` objects.
```java
library.displayInfo();
```

## Key Takeaway: Independent Existence
The crucial aspect of aggregation is that the contained objects can survive the destruction of the container. If the `library` object were deleted, the `book1`, `book2`, and `book3` objects would still exist in memory (assuming no other references to them are lost). They are not intrinsically tied to the Library for their lifecycle.

This contrasts with **composition**, where the contained object's lifecycle is dependent on the container object. In composition, if the container is destroyed, the contained object is also destroyed.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Department and Employee Aggregation
Create a `Department` class that has a name and an array of `Employee` objects. The `Employee` class should have name, id, and position. Create a main method where you create several employees, add them to a department, and display all employees in that department.

### Activity 2: University and Student Aggregation
Create a `University` class with name, location, and an array of `Student` objects. The `Student` class should have name, studentId, and major. Implement a method in `University` to display all students and another method to count students by major.

### Activity 3: Shopping Cart and Product Aggregation
Create a `ShoppingCart` class that contains an array of `Product` objects. The `Product` class should have name, price, and quantity. Implement methods to add products, remove products, and calculate the total price of all products in the cart. Show that products can exist independently of the cart.
