# Java Variables 

# What are Variables?

A variable is a reusable container for a value. It behaves as if it contains the value it holds.

Variable Categories

There are two main categories of variables in Java:

Primitive Variables

Definition: Simple values stored directly in memory (on the "stack").

Data Types:

int: Stores whole numbers (integers).

Example: int age = 21;

double: Stores numbers with a decimal portion.

Example: double price = 19.99;

char: Stores a single character. Characters are enclosed in single quotes.

Example: char grade = 'A';

boolean: Stores a truth value, either true or false.

Example: boolean isStudent = true;

Reference Variables

Definition: Store memory addresses (on the "stack") that point to locations in a different area of memory called the "heap."

Data Types (covered in this material):

String: Stores a sequence of characters (text). Strings are enclosed in double quotes.

Example: String name = "Bro Code";

Primitive Data Types in Detail

int (Integer)

Purpose: To store whole numbers without any decimal part.

Declaration: int variableName;

Assignment: variableName = value;

Combined Declaration and Assignment: int variableName = value;

Examples:
int age = 21;

int year = 2025;

int quantity = 1;

Important Note: Assigning a double value to an int variable results in an error because int variables cannot hold decimal
values.

double

Purpose: To store numbers that can have a decimal part.

Declaration: double variableName;

Assignment: variableName = value;

Combined Declaration and Assignment: double variableName = value;

Examples:

double price = 19.99;

double gpa = 3.5;

double temperature = -12.5;

Note: Assigning an int value to a double variable will automatically append .0 to the value.

char (Character)

Purpose: To store a single character. Characters must be enclosed in single quotes (').

Declaration: char variableName;

Assignment: variableName = 'value';

Combined Declaration and Assignment: char variableName = 'value';

Examples:

char grade = 'A';

char symbol = '!';

char currency = '$';

Important Note: Do not confuse single quotes for char with double quotes for String.

boolean

Purpose: To store one of two values: true or false.

Declaration: boolean variableName;

Assignment: variableName = true; or variableName = false;

Combined Declaration and Assignment: boolean variableName = true;

Camel Case Naming Convention: For variable names consisting of multiple words, the first word starts with a lowercase
letter, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., isStudent, forSale).

Examples:

boolean isStudent = true;

boolean forSale = false;

boolean isOnline = true;

Usage: Often used in conditional statements (if statements) to control program flow.

Reference Data Types in Detail

String

Purpose: To store a sequence of characters (text). Strings are enclosed in double quotes (").

Declaration: String variableName;

Assignment: variableName = "value";

Combined Declaration and Assignment: String variableName = "value";

Examples:

String name = "Bro Code";

String food = "pizza";

String email = "fake123@gmail.com";

String car = "Mustang";

String color = "red";

String Concatenation: You can combine strings with other strings or variables using the + operator.

Example: System.out.println("Hello " + name); would output "Hello Bro Code".

Note: Strings can contain numbers, but they are treated as characters, not as values for mathematical operations.


Outputting Variables

You can print the value of variables to the console using System.out.println().

Printing a single variable:

int age = 30;

System.out.println(age); // Output: 30

Printing a variable with text (concatenation):

String car = "Mustang";

int year = 2025;

System.out.println("Your choice is a " + car + " " + year); // Output: Your choice is a Mustang 2025

Pay attention to spacing when concatenating strings and variables. Add spaces within quotes where needed.

Example: Combining Variables in Output

Let's say you have the following variables:

String color = "red";

int year = 2025;

String car = "Mustang";

double price = 199999.99;

char currency = '$';

boolean forSale = true;

You can combine these in a print statement:

System.out.println("Your choice is a " + color + " " + year + " " + car);

System.out.println("The price is: " + currency + price);

if (forSale)
{
    System.out.println("There is a " + car + " for sale");
} 

else {
    System.out.println("The " + car + " is not for sale");
}

Expected Output:

Your choice is a red 2025 Mustang

The price is: $199999.99

There is a Mustang for sale

# Java Variables Practice Activities

## Activity 1: Variable Type Identification
**Instructions:** For each scenario below, identify the most appropriate Java variable type (int, double, char, boolean, or String) and write a sample declaration and initialization statement.

1. You need to store a person's age.
2. You need to track whether a user is logged into a system.
3. You need to store the price of an item with cents (like $19.99).
4. You need to store a single letter grade for a student.
5. You need to store a full name like "Alex Johnson".

**Challenge Question:** What type would you use to store a phone number like "555-123-4567"? Explain your reasoning.

## Activity 2: Code Analysis and Error Detection
**Instructions:** Examine the following code snippets and identify any errors or issues. Explain what's wrong and how to fix it.

**Snippet 1:**
```java
int quantity = 10.5;
String product = 'Laptop';
boolean onSale = "true";
```

**Snippet 2:**
```java
char middleInitial = "M";
double temperature = -15;
int score = 98.7;
```

**Snippet 3:**
```java
string firstName = "Jordan";
int age = twentyOne;
boolean isStudent = TRUE;
```

**Questions:**
1. In Snippet 1, what are the three errors and how would you fix them?
2. In Snippet 2, which line will cause issues and why?
3. In Snippet 3, what convention violations do you see?

## Activity 3: Output Prediction
**Instructions:** Given the code below, predict what will be displayed when it runs.

```java
public class PredictionActivity {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String carBrand = "Toyota";
        String model = "Camry";
        int year = 2023;
        double price = 25999.99;
        char condition = 'N';  // N for New, U for Used
        boolean isAvailable = true;
        
        System.out.println("Vehicle: " + year + " " + carBrand + " " + model);
        System.out.println("Price: $" + price);
        System.out.println("Condition: " + condition + " (New)");
        
        if (isAvailable) {
            System.out.println("Status: Available for purchase");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Status: Sold out");
        }
        
        // What will this print?
        System.out.println("Price with 5% discount: $" + (price * 0.95));
    }
}
```

**Questions:**
1. What will the first print statement output?
2. What will the second print statement output?
3. What will the if-else statement output?
4. What will the final print statement output? (Calculate the exact value)
5. If we changed `condition = 'U'`, how would the output change?
