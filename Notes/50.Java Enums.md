# Java Enums

## What are Enums?
Enums, short for enumerations, are a special type of Java class used to represent a fixed set of constants. They offer several benefits:

**Improved Readability:** Enums make code easier to understand by using meaningful names for constants instead of raw numbers or strings.

**Enhanced Reliability:** They prevent common programming errors by restricting values to a predefined set.

**Efficiency:** Enums are more efficient when used with switch statements compared to strings.

## Declaring an Enum
An enum is declared similarly to a class, but using the `enum` keyword.

```java
public enum Day {
    // Enum constants declared here
}
```

## Enum Constants
Enum constants are declared within the enum body. By convention, they are written in all uppercase letters.

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY,
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
}
```

## Associating Values with Enum Constants
You can associate values with enum constants by defining a constructor and fields within the enum.

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY(1),
    MONDAY(2),
    TUESDAY(3),
    WEDNESDAY(4),
    THURSDAY(5),
    FRIDAY(6),
    SATURDAY(7); // Semicolon is required if you have methods or constructors

    private final int dayNumber; // Private and final fields

    // Constructor (implicitly called for each constant)
    Day(int dayNumber) {
        this.dayNumber = dayNumber;
    }

    // Getter method to access the associated value
    public int getDayNumber() {
        return dayNumber;
    }
}
```

- The constructor is automatically called for each enum constant when the enum is initialized.
- The values in parentheses (e.g., 1, 2) are passed as arguments to the constructor.
- It's common practice to make the fields private and final to ensure immutability.
- A semicolon is required after the last enum constant if you define methods or constructors within the enum body.

## Using Enums

### Accessing Enum Constants
You access enum constants using the enum name followed by a dot (`.`) and the constant name.

```java
Day today = Day.MONDAY;
System.out.println(today); // Output: MONDAY
```

### Accessing Associated Values
You can retrieve the values associated with enum constants using getter methods.

```java
Day today = Day.MONDAY;
System.out.println(today.getDayNumber()); // Output: 2
```

### Using Enums in Switch Statements
Enums are particularly powerful when used in switch statements. They offer better performance and readability than using strings.

```java
Day currentDay = Day.WEDNESDAY;

switch (currentDay) {
    case MONDAY:
    case TUESDAY:
    case WEDNESDAY:
    case THURSDAY:
    case FRIDAY:
        System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
        break;
    case SATURDAY:
    case SUNDAY:
        System.out.println("It is the weekend.");
        break;
}
```

- When using enums in switch statements, you do not need to enclose the case labels in quotes.
- Multiple cases can be combined using commas for conciseness.

### Handling User Input with Enums
When accepting user input that maps to an enum, you often need to convert the input string to an enum constant. The `valueOf()` method is useful here.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EnumInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a day of the week: ");
        String response = scanner.nextLine().toUpperCase(); // Convert input to uppercase

        try {
            Day selectedDay = Day.valueOf(response); // Convert string to enum constant
            System.out.println("You selected: " + selectedDay);
            System.out.println("Day number: " + selectedDay.getDayNumber());

            if (selectedDay == Day.SATURDAY || selectedDay == Day.SUNDAY) {
                System.out.println("It's the weekend!");
            } else {
                System.out.println("It's a weekday.");
            }
        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid day entered. Please enter a valid day (e.g., MONDAY, TUESDAY).");
        } finally {
            scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
        }
    }
}
```

- The `toUpperCase()` method is used to match the user's input with the uppercase enum constants.
- `Day.valueOf(response)` attempts to find an enum constant whose name matches the response string.
- If no matching constant is found, `valueOf()` throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. This should be handled using a try-catch block to provide a user-friendly error message.
- It's important to close the Scanner resource.

## Benefits Summarized
**Readability:** `Day.MONDAY` is much clearer than `1` or `"Monday"`.

**Type Safety:** You cannot accidentally assign an invalid value (like `Day.PIZZA`) if it's not defined in the enum.

**Maintainability:** If you need to change the underlying value of a constant (e.g., reorder days), you only need to modify the enum definition.

**Performance:** switch statements with enums are generally faster than those with strings.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Traffic Light System
Create an enum `TrafficLight` with values `RED`, `YELLOW`, and `GREEN`. Each light should have:
1. A duration (seconds) associated with it
2. A message to display (e.g., "Stop" for RED)
3. A method that simulates the light behavior (prints the message and waits for the duration)
Create a program that cycles through the traffic lights automatically.

### Activity 2: Card Deck
Create an enum `Suit` (HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES) and an enum `Rank` (ACE, TWO, THREE, ..., KING). Create a `Card` class that combines a suit and rank. Then:
1. Create a full deck of 52 cards
2. Shuffle the deck
3. Deal 5 cards to a player
4. Determine the highest card in a hand based on rank and suit hierarchy

### Activity 3: Online Order Status Tracker
Create an enum `OrderStatus` with values:
- `PENDING` ("Order received, awaiting payment")
- `PAID` ("Payment confirmed, processing order")
- `SHIPPED` ("Order shipped, tracking available")
- `DELIVERED` ("Order delivered successfully")
- `CANCELLED` ("Order cancelled")

Create an `Order` class with status field. Implement:
1. Update order status with validation (can't go back to previous statuses)
2. Display order history with timestamps
3. Calculate time spent in each status
4. Simulate an order going through all statuses
