# Enhanced Switches in Java

## What are Enhanced Switches?

Enhanced switches, introduced in Java 14, are a modern and more efficient alternative to traditional if-else if-else statements for handling multiple conditional checks. They offer a cleaner syntax and improved readability, especially when dealing with a series of conditions based on the value of a single variable.

## Why Use Enhanced Switches?

1. **Readability**: Enhanced switches are generally easier to read and understand than long chains of if-else if statements.
2. **Conciseness**: They reduce boilerplate code, making your programs shorter and more maintainable.
3. **Efficiency**: While not explicitly detailed in the material, enhanced switches can lead to more optimized code generation by the Java compiler.
4. **Error Reduction**: The structured nature of enhanced switches can help prevent common errors associated with complex conditional logic.

## Traditional if-else if vs. Enhanced Switch

### Traditional if-else if Example

```java
String day = "Friday";

if (day.equals("Monday")) {
    System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
} else if (day.equals("Tuesday")) {
    System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
} else if (day.equals("Wednesday")) {
    System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
} else if (day.equals("Thursday")) {
    System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
} else if (day.equals("Friday")) {
    System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
} else if (day.equals("Saturday")) {
    System.out.println("It is the weekend.");
} else if (day.equals("Sunday")) {
    System.out.println("It is the weekend.");
} else {
    System.out.println(day + " is not a day.");
}
```

This approach involves repetitive checks and can become cumbersome with many conditions.

### Enhanced Switch Example

The core syntax of an enhanced switch involves the `switch` keyword, a variable or expression to evaluate, and a set of curly braces `{}` containing `case` labels and corresponding actions. The arrow operator `->` replaces the traditional colon `:` and `break` statement.

```java
String day = "Monday";

switch (day) {
    case "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" -> {
        System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
    }
    case "Saturday", "Sunday" -> {
        System.out.println("It is the weekend.");
    }
    default -> {
        System.out.println(day + " is not a day.");
    }
}
```

## Key Components of Enhanced Switches

### The `switch` Statement

**Syntax:** `switch (expression) { ... }`

The `expression` is the variable or value that will be evaluated against the different cases. This can be a `String`, `int`, `char`, `byte`, `short`, `enum`, or any object type.

### `case` Labels

**Purpose:** To define specific values that the expression will be compared against.

**Syntax:** `case value1, value2, ... -> { // code block }`

**Multiple Cases:** You can group multiple case labels together by separating them with commas. All cases in a comma-separated list will execute the same code block. This is a significant improvement over traditional switches where you would have to break after each case or fall through intentionally.

**Data Types:** Cases must be compatible with the type of the expression.

### The Arrow Operator (`->`)

**Purpose:** Replaces the colon (`:`) and `break` statement found in traditional switch statements.

**Functionality:** When a case matches the expression, the code block following the `->` is executed. Once the code block is finished, the switch statement terminates. There is no fall-through behavior by default.

### The `default` Case

**Purpose:** Acts as a fallback mechanism, similar to the `else` block in if-else if statements.

**Syntax:** `default -> { // code block }`

**Functionality:** If none of the preceding `case` labels match the expression, the code block associated with the `default` case is executed.

**Placement:** The `default` case can be placed anywhere within the `switch` block, but it's common practice to put it at the end for readability.

## Handling User Input with Enhanced Switches

Enhanced switches are particularly useful when processing user input, where the input can vary widely.

### Example with User Input

This example demonstrates how to use a Scanner to get input from the user and then process it with an enhanced switch.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EnhancedSwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the day of the week: ");
        String day = scanner.nextLine();

        switch (day) {
            case "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" -> {
                System.out.println("It is a weekday.");
            }
            case "Saturday", "Sunday" -> {
                System.out.println("It is the weekend.");
            }
            default -> {
                System.out.println(day + " is not a valid day of the week.");
            }
        }

        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner to release resources
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`import java.util.Scanner;`**: Imports the Scanner class, which is needed for reading user input.
2. **`Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`**: Creates a Scanner object that reads input from the standard input stream (`System.in`).
3. **`System.out.print("Enter the day of the week: ");`**: Prompts the user to enter a day.
4. **`String day = scanner.nextLine();`**: Reads the entire line of text entered by the user and stores it in the `day` variable.
5. **The `switch` statement** then evaluates the `day` variable:
   - If `day` matches any of "Monday" through "Friday", it prints "It is a weekday."
   - If `day` matches "Saturday" or "Sunday", it prints "It is the weekend."
   - If `day` does not match any of the above, the `default` case is executed, printing that the input is not a valid day.
6. **`scanner.close();`**: It's good practice to close the Scanner when you're finished with it to free up system resources.

## When to Use Enhanced Switches

You should consider using enhanced switches whenever you find yourself writing a series of if-else if statements that check the equality of a single variable against multiple distinct values. They are especially beneficial for:

- Categorizing input.
- Handling different states or modes.
- Implementing menu-driven interfaces.
- Simplifying complex conditional logic.

# Enhanced Switch Activities

## Activity 1: Smart Calculator with Multiple Operations
Create a calculator that uses enhanced switches for different operations:

**Operations to support:**
1. Basic arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %
2. Scientific functions: sqrt, pow, log, sin, cos, tan
3. Unit conversions: temperature (C↔F↔K), length (m↔ft↔in), weight (kg↔lb)
4. Financial calculations: interest, loan payments, currency conversion

**Requirements:**
- Use enhanced switch with arrow operators
- Support multi-case grouping (e.g., "+", "add", "plus" all do addition)
- Include error handling for invalid operations
- Use switch expressions that return values
- Create a menu system for operation selection

**Sample menu:**
```
1. Basic Arithmetic
2. Scientific Functions
3. Unit Conversion
4. Financial Tools
5. Exit
```

## Activity 2: Adventure Game Decision Engine
Create a text-based adventure game using enhanced switches:

**Game Features:**
1. **Multiple locations**: Forest, Cave, Castle, Village, Mountain
2. **Actions available**: look, take, use, talk, move, fight
3. **Inventory system**: items affect available actions
4. **NPC interactions**: different responses based on character

**Enhanced Switch Usage:**
- Switch on location + action combinations
- Switch on item usage combinations
- Switch on dialogue choices
- Switch on enemy types and attack methods

**Example:**
```java
switch (currentLocation + ":" + action) {
    case "Forest:look" -> System.out.println("You see tall trees and hear birds chirping.");
    case "Forest:take" -> {
        if (inventory.contains("axe")) {
            System.out.println("You chop wood and add it to your inventory.");
            inventory.add("wood");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You need an axe to chop wood.");
        }
    }
    case "Cave:enter" -> {
        if (inventory.contains("torch")) {
            System.out.println("You enter the dark cave, your torch illuminating the way.");
            currentLocation = "Cave";
        } else {
            System.out.println("It's too dark to enter without a light source.");
        }
    }
    // ... more cases
}
```

## Activity 3: Restaurant Ordering System
Create a restaurant ordering system using enhanced switches:

**Menu Categories:**
1. **Appetizers**: Soup, Salad, Wings, Nachos
2. **Main Courses**: Burger, Pizza, Pasta, Steak, Chicken
3. **Drinks**: Soda, Juice, Coffee, Tea, Beer, Wine
4. **Desserts**: Cake, Ice Cream, Pie, Cheesecake

**Order Processing Features:**
1. **Item selection** with modifiers (e.g., burger: cheese, bacon, avocado)
2. **Meal combos** (e.g., burger + fries + drink = discounted price)
3. **Special dietary** options (vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan)
4. **Time-based** specials (lunch vs dinner menu, happy hour drinks)
5. **Seasonal** menu items

**Enhanced Switch Implementation:**
- Switch on menu categories
- Switch on item + modifier combinations
- Switch on combo meals
- Switch on dietary restrictions
- Use switch expressions to calculate prices

**Challenge:** Create a "smart order suggester" that uses switches to suggest complementary items based on what's already in the order (e.g., suggests wine with steak, dessert after pasta).
