# Java Substrings and Email Slicing

## Introduction to substring()

The `substring()` method in Java is a powerful tool for extracting portions of a string. It allows you to create a new string based on the characters within a specified range of an existing string.

---

## Syntax

The `substring()` method can be used in two ways:

1. **`string.substring(int beginIndex)`**: This form extracts all characters from `beginIndex` to the end of the string.
2. **`string.substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)`**: This form extracts characters from `beginIndex` up to, but **not including**, `endIndex`.

---

## Key Concepts

- **Indices**: String indices in Java start at 0. The first character is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.
- **`endIndex` is Exclusive**: When using the two-argument version of `substring()`, the character at the `endIndex` is **not** included in the resulting substring.
- **Creating New Strings**: `substring()` does **not** modify the original string. It always returns a **new** string object.

## Email Slicing Example

A practical application of the `substring()` method is creating an "email slicer" program. This program can take an email address as input and separate it into its username and domain components.

### Core Logic

1. **Get User Input**: Use the Scanner class to prompt the user to enter their email address.
2. **Validate Email**: Check if the entered email contains the "@" symbol. If not, inform the user that the email is invalid.
3. **Extract Username**: Use `substring()` to get the part of the email before the "@" symbol.
4. **Extract Domain**: Use `substring()` to get the part of the email after the "@" symbol.

## Finding Indices with indexOf()

Manually counting indices for `substring()` can be error-prone, especially if email addresses have varying lengths. The `indexOf()` method is crucial for making this process dynamic.

- **`string.indexOf(String str)`**: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring (`str`) within the string. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.

## Putting it Together: Code Breakdown

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Import the Scanner class for user input

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the console
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Declare variables to store email components
        String email;
        String username;
        String domain;

        // Prompt the user to enter their email
        System.out.print("Enter your email: ");

        // Read the entire line of input from the user
        email = scanner.nextLine();

        // Check if the email contains the "@" symbol
        if (email.contains("@")) {
            // Extract the username: from index 0 up to (but not including) the "@" symbol
            // email.indexOf("@") finds the index of the "@" symbol
            username = email.substring(0, email.indexOf("@"));

            // Extract the domain: from the character *after* the "@" symbol to the end of the string
            // email.indexOf("@") + 1 ensures we start *after* the "@"
            domain = email.substring(email.indexOf("@") + 1);

            // Print the extracted username and domain
            System.out.println("Username: " + username);
            System.out.println("Domain: " + domain);
        } else {
            // If the email does not contain "@", print an error message
            System.out.println("Emails must contain @");
        }

        // Close the scanner to release system resources
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

## Example Walkthrough

Let's trace the execution with the email address `example.user123@university.edu`:

1. **Input**: `email = "example.user123@university.edu"`
2. **`email.contains("@")`**: This evaluates to `true`.
3. **`email.indexOf("@")`**: This will return the index of the "@" symbol. Counting from 0:
   - `e` is at index 0
   - `x` is at index 1
   - ...
   - `3` is at index 15
   - `@` is at index 16. So, `email.indexOf("@")` returns 16.
4. **`username = email.substring(0, email.indexOf("@"))`**:
   - This becomes `username = email.substring(0, 16)`.
   - This extracts characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 16.
   - Result: `username = "example.user123"`
5. **`domain = email.substring(email.indexOf("@") + 1)`**:
   - This becomes `domain = email.substring(16 + 1)`.
   - This becomes `domain = email.substring(17)`.
   - This extracts characters from index 17 to the end of the string.
   - Result: `domain = "university.edu"`
6. **Output**:
   ```
   Username: example.user123
   Domain: university.edu
   ```

## Summary of Methods Used

- **`String.substring(int beginIndex)`**: Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of this string.
- **`String.substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)`**: Returns a new string that is a substring of this string. The substring begins at the specified `beginIndex` and extends to the character at index `endIndex - 1`.
- **`String.indexOf(String str)`**: Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified substring.
- **`String.contains(CharSequence s)`**: Returns true if and only if this string contains the specified sequence of char values.
- **`Scanner.nextLine()`**: Reads the next line of text from the input.
- **`Scanner.close()`**: Closes this scanner and releases any system resources associated with it.

# Substring Activities

## Activity 1: Advanced Email Analyzer
Extend the basic email slicer to provide more detailed analysis:

**Requirements:**
1. Extract and separate the domain and extension (e.g., from "university.edu" → domain: "university", extension: "edu")
2. Check for valid email format (must have exactly one "@" symbol, domain must contain a dot)
3. Categorize email domains:
   - .edu → Educational
   - .com → Commercial
   - .org → Organization
   - .gov → Government
   - .net → Network
   - Others → Unknown
4. Check username security:
   - Warn if username is too short (< 5 characters)
   - Warn if username contains only numbers
   - Check if username contains common patterns like "admin" or "user"

**Sample Output:**
```
Email: john.doe@harvard.edu
Username: john.doe
Domain: harvard.edu
Organization Type: Educational
Username Security: Good
```

## Activity 2: File Path Parser
Create a program that parses file paths and extracts different components:

**Parse paths like:** `/home/user/documents/report.pdf`

**Extract:**
1. **File name** (e.g., "report.pdf")
2. **File extension** (e.g., "pdf")
3. **Directory path** (e.g., "/home/user/documents/")
4. **Parent directory** (e.g., "documents")

**Handle different formats:**
- Windows paths: `C:\Users\John\Documents\file.txt`
- Unix/Linux paths: `/home/user/file.txt`
- Relative paths: `../images/photo.jpg`
- URLs: `https://website.com/path/to/resource.html`

**Bonus:** Create a method to detect the operating system based on the path format.

## Activity 3: Text Extraction Challenge
Create a program that can extract specific information from structured text:

**Scenario 1: Extracting Phone Numbers**
From text: "Call me at (555) 123-4567 or (888) 999-0000"
Extract all phone numbers in standard format.

**Scenario 2: Extracting Dates**
From text: "Meeting on 2023-12-25, then again on 01/15/2024"
Extract and reformat dates to a consistent format.

**Scenario 3: Extracting Hashtags and Mentions**
From social media text: "Loving #Java programming! Follow @JavaDev for tips #coding"
Extract all hashtags and mentions.

**Scenario 4: Extracting URLs**
From text: "Visit https://example.com or http://test.org/page"
Extract all URLs.

**Your program should:**
- Use `substring()` with `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`
- Handle edge cases (multiple occurrences, missing data)
- Validate extracted data (e.g., phone numbers must have 10 digits)
- Format extracted data consistently
