# Java-Programming-Notes

I created comprehensive notes for Bro Code's Java course because I often struggle with identifying what's important. My solution: use AI to generate structured notes, then paraphrase them

Each topic folder contains:
1. **Main notes** - Concepts explained 
2. **3 activities** - Practical exercises to better grasp each concept

This approach helps me learn more effectively by combining AI-generated structure with personal understanding through paraphrasing and hands-on practice.
